  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Pyramids have been reckoned among the
wonders of the world, and every effort has been
made to discover for what purpose they were constructed,
and by whom they were built.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their immense size, their solid construction, the
lonely positions in which they are placed, add to the
amazement of the spectator.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many conjectures and assertions have been made
regarding them. Some assert they were the tombs of
the kings of Egypt, and others differ, and say they
were built for astronomical purposes; and those who
give up guessing or speculating regarding them, consider
they were the tokens of the folly and tyranny
of the rulers of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>All travellers, and learned men and women who
have visited these gigantic monuments, admit their
grandeur, and admire their sublimity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many expeditions have been sent to Egypt for the
purpose of gaining information regarding these Pyramids;
and many public and private individuals have
spent princely fortunes in exploring them; and on
almost every occasion a book has been written, and
given to the world, showing the result of each expedition.
Everything that could possibly be said and
written regarding these relics of antiquity has been
given forth to the world in all languages, from the
remotest times till the present day.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is now the pleasant task of the author to state
that the vexed question may be set at rest, as the
solution to the mystery has been found. The discovery
was made whilst reading the latest works on
the Pyramids; she recognised some features in the
interior of the Great Pyramid, and recalled to mind
for what purpose such passages have been used, and
followed up the incident by reading more carefully
every book, and examining all the illustrations showing
the interior and the exterior of the noble buildings,
till ultimately there remained not the shadow of a
doubt that the discovery was real. The sensation
after the removal of doubt was painful. When this
sensation of amazement and wonder had passed away,
a feeling of gratitude took possession of the mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>This memorable discovery was made in August
1880. Began writing this work on the 20th August
and finished it on the 30th November.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The entire
work has been begun and brought to a conclusion
without the assistance of any person.</p>

<p class='c006'>The narrative connected with the Pyramids is
most touching; on that account the writer proposes
giving the life of the builder as she describes these
wonderful monuments of antiquity. She has never
attempted writing for publication before, therefore
she humbly prays the reader to be indulgent and
to overlook all errors and shortcomings, and to
believe that this volume is brought before the world
simply to uphold the truth of the Holy Bible which
has recorded the narrative; and the appositeness of
St. Paul’s assertion, that God hath chosen the foolish
things of the world to confound the wise; and God
hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound
the things which are mighty; and base things
of the world, and things which are despised, hath
God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring
to nought the things that are.</p>

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER I.</span><br /> <br />JOSEPH—THE BUILDER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Joseph was the son of Jacob’s old age, and consequently
he loved him more than any of his other
sons, by which Joseph incurred the envy and hatred
of his brothers, and they, knowing that the lad
carried evil reports of their conduct to their father,
determined to do him some harm. Besides, Joseph
was always having strange dreams, which he related
to his father in the presence of his brothers, which
dreams were interpreted to mean some great advancement
in the life of the dreamer. The brothers
watched for an opportunity to get rid of this
favourite child. The opportunity presented itself,
and they availed themselves of it. Jacob sent
Joseph to see the state of affairs in the field where
the flocks were fed, and to bring him word; so
Joseph, in obedience to his father’s command, went,
and when the brothers who were guarding the flocks
saw him approaching, they agreed to kill him. But
one of the elder ones said that it would be a great
sin to shed the blood of their relative, and that it
would be better to throw him into a pit and leave
him there to die; to which suggestion the rest consented.
When Joseph came up to them, they insulted
him, and stripped him of the coat which his
father, in his fondness for him, had made for him, and,
unheeding the lad’s cries and remonstrances, they
threw him into a pit. After this cruel deed, the
men went to their meal; and whilst eating it they
saw a caravan of Ishmaelites, and to them they sold
Joseph, who was taken out of the pit and given
to them. The Ishmaelites, fearing that Joseph was
not a slave, judging from his handsome face and
noble carriage, sold him to a company of Midianites,
merchants going down to Egypt. When these
merchants arrived in Egypt, they sold him as a
slave to an Egyptian nobleman. Here he was kindly
treated by his master, who had confidence in his
integrity, and was made an overseer of his master’s
property. Joseph was seventeen years old when he
was taken away from his home and country, and his
father mourned for him as dead. This took place in
the year 1728 B.C.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ways of the Almighty God are mysterious,
and far above human comprehension. God blessed
Joseph, and he grew into man’s estate goodly and
well-favoured.</p>

<p class='c006'>His master’s wife noticed him and became madly
enamoured; losing all self-control, she made criminal
advances to him, which he repelled, and
entreated her to remember that he was her husband’s
trusted servant, and that she should not induce him
to commit such wickedness against his master and
sin in the sight of God. She still persisted, till at
last she used force, and he fled from her presence,
leaving a piece of his coat by which she held him.
Seeing that he was not to be overcome, she hated
him, and, to revenge herself on him, she reversed the
story and told it to her husband, who, believing
her tale, became very angry with Joseph and prosecuted
him. Though the Court wherein he was tried
found him innocent, yet the nobleman persuaded
the judge to place Joseph in confinement, that his
wife’s conduct might not be made public; and, as
Joseph had neither friends nor means, he was helpless,
and consequently was sent to prison, where he
remained many years.</p>

<p class='c006'>In his solitude, the mind of the captive must have
often recalled scenes of home, and all the lessons
that he had learnt orally—as was the custom in
the East—and remembered the great deeds and
renown of his ancestors, and the marvellous acts of
God towards Noah and Abraham and Isaac, and his
own father Jacob, who was surnamed by God Israel.
In regarding his miserable condition he must have
thought of the visit to Egypt of his great-grandfather,
Abraham, who came as a prince, and was treated
by the king as his friend; and how the king, when
he found he was misinformed by Abraham regarding
his wife, made honourable amends, and gave him
flocks and herds as presents; and when the famine
in Canaan was over, he and his wife and their nephew
left Egypt in state (the Egyptian historians call these
visitors “Shepherd Kings”); and how when there
was another famine in Canaan, in the lifetime of
Isaac, there was corn in Egypt, and Isaac would have
visited Egypt as did his father, but that he was
forbidden by God.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus time sped till Joseph was thirty years old,
when Pharaoh, King of Egypt, was warned in dreams
of the approach of the great and memorable famine,
which was to last seven long years, during which
time the earth would make its sabbath, and produce
no food for man or beast. It was then that the
unhappy captive was remembered by a fellow-prisoner,
whose dream Joseph had interpreted, and
which was realised as he predicted; so that, when
all the wise men of Egypt could not tell the King
the meaning of his dreams, and when the King in his
disappointed rage was about to condemn them to
death, Joseph was called.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was taken from the prison and brought before
the King, who, seeing in him a superior deportment
and a stately person, came down from his throne and
addressed him as an equal; he told him his dreams,
and said there was none who could interpret them,
and that he had heard that he understood dreams and
could interpret them. Joseph answered the King
with humility, and told him what was the will of
God regarding the land of Egypt; that there would
be seven years of great plenty throughout all the
land of Egypt, and after them seven years of famine;
that all the plenty would be forgotten in the land
of Egypt, and the famine would consume the land.
Joseph advised Pharaoh to look out for a man
discreet and wise, and set him over the land of
Egypt; to appoint officers over the land, and to
take up the fifth part of the produce of the land of
Egypt in the seven plenteous years; to let them
gather all the food of those good years that were to
come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh,
and let them keep food in the cities, that it might
be for store to the land against the seven years of
famine which should be in the land of Egypt, that
the land might not perish through the famine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pharaoh was greatly pleased, both at the interpretation
and the advice; and, as there was none like
him, in whom was the spirit of God, Pharaoh made
Joseph the Viceroy of Egypt; and Pharaoh took off
his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph’s
hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and
put a gold chain about his neck; and he made him
ride in the second chariot which he had, and the
people cried before him, “Bow the knee!” or
“Bend the knee!” and Pharaoh made him ruler
of all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, “I am Pharaoh,
and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or
foot in all the land of Egypt.” And Pharaoh called
Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah, or “Preserver
of the Age.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Consequently Joseph had absolute power vested
in him. The King also gave him to wife Asenath,
the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On. And Joseph
went throughout all the land of Egypt. And in the
seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
handfuls. And he gathered up all the food of the
seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and
laid up the food in the cities; the food of the field,
which was round about every city, laid he up in the
same. And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the
sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it
was without number.</p>

<p class='c006'>The land of Egypt is six hundred miles long, and
is bounded by two ranges of naked limestone hills
which sometimes approach, and sometimes retire from
each other, leaving between them an average breadth
of seven miles. Northwards they part and finally disappear,
giving place to a marshy meadow plain which
extends to the Mediterranean coast. To the south
they are no longer of limestone, but of granite; they
narrow to a point; they close till they almost touch;
and through the mountain gate thus formed the river
Nile leaps with a roar into the valley, and runs
due north towards the sea. This land and its neighbourhood
was first inhabited by the descendants of
Ham, the third son of Noah; Mizraim, the second
son of Ham, occupied Egypt. The noble river Nile
is recorded in the Scriptures as the second river
which parted from the main stream which went out
of Eden to water the garden where Adam and Eve
were placed by their Creator.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the winter and spring it rolls a languid stream
through a dry and dusty plain; but in the summer
an extraordinary thing happens. The river grows
troubled and swift, it turns red and then green; it
rises, it swells, till at length, overflowing its banks,
it covers the adjoining lands to the base of the hills
on either side. The whole valley becomes a lake,
from which the villages rise like islands, for they are
built on artificial mounds. The land of Egypt is
by nature a rainless desert, which the Nile, the mysterious
Nile only, converts into a fruitful garden
every year.</p>

<p class='c006'>The task that Joseph had been entrusted with was
stupendous. He had to build storehouses that would
contain all the fifth part of the produce of the
plenteous years of the fertile land of Egypt that
were gathered up during the seven years. Before
he set himself to the building of these vast receptacles
he must have searched for models, and whilst
doing this the building of the Tower of Babel must
have come to his recollection, for the father of Abraham
was the chief officer of King Nimrod who
built it. This was a grand model, and that he followed
it is evident from what we see in the Pyramids,
or Storehouses of the King, in this, the nineteenth
century of our Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the Temple at Jerusalem was about to be
built by Solomon, he must have read how the storehouses
were built, and he must have been aware for
what use they were intended, as well as by whom
they were built. Solomon married the daughter of
Pharaoh, King of Egypt, and as son-in-law of the
King he must have had free access to all the secret
buildings and records of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the account of the building of the Temple:
Solomon laid the foundations of the Temple very
deep in the rock of Moriah, and the materials were
strong stones, and such as would resist the force
of time; these were to unite themselves with the
rock, and become a basis and a sure foundation
for that superstructure which was to be erected
over it. They were to be so strong in order to
sustain with ease those vast superstructures and
precious ornaments, whose own weight was to be
not less than the weight of those other high and
heavy buildings which the King designed to be very
ornamental and magnificent. He erected its entire
body, quite up to the roof, of white stone; its height
was sixty cubits, its length was the same, and
its breadth was twenty. There was another building
erected over it, equal to it in its measures, so that
the entire altitude of the Temple was a hundred and
twenty cubits. Its front was to the east.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the whole structure of the Temple was made,
with great skill, of polished stones, laid together so
very harmoniously and smoothly that there appeared
to the spectators no signs of any hammer, or other
instrument of architecture, but as if, without any use
of them, the materials had naturally united themselves
together, the agreement of one part with
another seeming rather to be natural, than to have
arisen from the force of tools upon them. The King
also had a fine contrivance for an ascent to the
upper room over the Temple, and that was by steps
in the thickness of its wall; for it had no large door
on the east end, as the lower house had, but the
entrances were by the sides, through very small
doors. He also overlaid the Temple, both within
and without, with boards of cedar, that were kept
close together by thick chains, so that this contrivance
was in the nature of a support and strength to the
building.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Temple was built on the crown of Moriah,
“the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite” (2 Chr. iii. 1),
with a surrounding platform six hundred and
twelve feet square. The building called the Naos
would seem to have stood on the summit of the rock,
in which graduated platforms were cut, forming the
courts of the Jews and women. The Naos was small
(sixty by twenty cubits), and was divided into the
Holy of Holies and Holy Place, the former used once
a year, the latter occupied only by the priests performing
daily service. In the former was the Ark; in the
latter the altar of incense, with the table of Shew-bread
on its one side, and golden candlestick on the
other. These two parts were separated by a veil,
which was rent at the crucifixion (Matt. xxvii. 51).
The court of the Gentiles surrounded the Naos, but
was on a lower platform, separated by a trellis fence.
The Naos was, like Mount Sinai, the sanctuary of
Jehovah, fenced off from the Gentiles’ court, the
plain below.</p>

<p class='c006'>Solomon must have referred to the discovery that
he had made regarding these buildings (the Pyramids)
and to the builder of them, when he said: “Better
is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish
king, who will no more be admonished. For out of
prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
born in his kingdom becometh poor” (Eccl. iv. 13, 14).</p>

<p class='c006'>Joseph built these storehouses near the fields of
every city, according to the size of the city and the
number of its inhabitants. In the north, near
the Delta, he built many and large, according to the
amount of corn the fields there yielded. He was
occupied seven years in building them, and during
the time thus occupied, he must often have recalled
the fond memories of home, and of his aged father,
and his youngest brother, the son of his deceased
mother; and doubtless the three largest Pyramids of
Jeezeh he dedicated to the memory of his ancestors,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>

<p class='c006'>So Joseph laid the foundations of each storehouse
very deep in the rock on which it was built, and the
materials were strong stones, such as would resist
the force of time; these were to unite themselves
with the rock, and become a basis and a sure foundation
for that superstructure which was to be erected
over it. They were to be so strong in order to sustain
with ease those vast superstructures whose own
weight was to be not less than the weight of the
casing stones which he designed to be used. He
erected its entire body, quite up to the roof, of stone.
Its base was square, the sides rising up slantwise, till
there was only a small square aperture left unfinished;
these sides were in steps, so that the labourers could
ascend to the aperture.</p>

<p class='c006'>The interior had chambers for the officers to
reckon the quantity of corn stored, and for the
measure a stone coffer or box to measure the corn
with. There were vast chasms and receptacles with
passages like tubes leading to them, all the length
from the walls, with their mouths outside the walls,
which Egyptologists call air passages, so that the
men could get to them from the exterior by the
steps. The corn was thrown into these vast spaces
from outside, from the apertures in the sides, and
the aperture at the summit. When the whole receptacle
was well filled with the corn, which was as
plentiful as the sand of the sea, then all the apertures
were stopped with stones, like stoppers of bottles,
made for the purpose. The side steps were then
encased, from the base to the summit, with large
casing stones, so that the sides became level, and,
with the coatings of cement, the entire building outside
became level and smooth, and the top in a
peak.</p>

<p class='c006'>The corn within this grand storehouse was hermetically
sealed, utterly impervious to the sun, rain, and
wind. The doors of it, as in Solomon’s temple, were
small, and in the sides. Now the whole of this structure
was made, with great skill, of stones, and those
laid together so very harmoniously and smoothly that
there appeared to the spectators no signs of any hammer
or other instrument of architecture, but as if,
without any use of them, the materials had naturally
united themselves together, the agreement of one
part with another seeming rather to be natural than
to have arisen from the force of tools upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The foresight and discretion of Joseph were rewarded
by Pharaoh, who gave him the powers of a
king and the attributes of a god.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the seven years of plenteousness that was in
the land of Egypt were ended, according as Joseph
had said, and the dearth was in all lands; but in all
the land of Egypt there was bread. And the famine
was over all the face of the earth. Joseph opened all
the storehouses, and sold corn unto the Egyptians;
and all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy
corn, because the famine was sore in all lands.
Now Joseph’s thoughts reverted to his father’s home,
and he knew that his brothers would be obliged to
come to Egypt to purchase food, for the famine was
very grievous in the land of Canaan. He gave orders
that no man desiring corn should send his servant to
purchase it, but that the head of each family should
personally appear as a purchaser; he also proclaimed
that no man should be allowed to purchase corn in
Egypt to sell it again in other countries, but only
such as he required for the support of his immediate
family; neither should any purchaser be allowed to
buy more corn than one animal could carry. He put
guards at all the gates of Egypt, and every man who
passed through the gates was obliged to record his
name and the name of his father in a book, which
was brought by the guards every night for Joseph’s
inspection. By doing this he ascertained when his
brethren entered Egypt. When they came and stood
before him, they wondered at his magnificence, the
handsome appearance and the majestic presence of
the powerful man, but they did not recognise in him
their brother. He sold them corn, but contrived to
entrap them, so that they should bring down with
them his own brother Benjamin, who did not come
with them this time; they departed, leaving an hostage
with Joseph, and on their next visit to buy corn
they brought with them his brother Benjamin, and a
letter and presents from Jacob. When Joseph recognised
his father’s hand, his feelings grew too strong
for him; the recollections of his youth overpowered
him, and, retiring into a side apartment, he wept bitterly.
He entertained all his brothers, and sold them
corn, but the price thereof he returned without their
knowledge into the sacks of each of his brothers.
Before they left Egypt he made himself known to
them, and, after greetings and explanations, he presented
his brothers to Pharaoh; and Pharaoh, seeing
they were goodly men, was much pleased and very
gracious towards them. Then it was arranged that
Jacob should come with all his family into Egypt;
and Pharaoh gave his chariots for their accommodation.
In due time Jacob and all his family came
into Egypt. Joseph went to meet his father, dressed
in royal robes, with the crown of state upon his
head; and when he came within fifty cubits of his
father’s company, he descended from his chariot and
walked to meet his father. Now when the nobles
and princes of Egypt saw this, they too descended
from their steeds and chariots and walked with him.
And when Jacob saw all this great procession he
wondered exceedingly, and he was much pleased
thereat, and, turning to Judah, he asked, “Who is
the man who marcheth at the head of this great array
in royal robes?” Judah answered, “This is thy
son.” And when Joseph drew nigh to his father he
bowed down before him, and his officers also bowed
low to Jacob. And Jacob ran towards his son and
fell upon his neck and kissed him, and they wept and
shed tears of joy and gratitude. Joseph greeted
his brethren with affection. And Joseph brought his
father and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob
blessed Pharaoh. And the King said unto Jacob,
“How old art thou?” And Jacob answered him,
and said, “The days of the years of my pilgrimage
are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have
the days of the years of my life been, and have not
attained unto the days of the years of the life of my
fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph placed his father and his brethren,
and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in
the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as
Pharaoh had commanded. And Joseph nourished his
father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household,
with bread according to their families (1706 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).</p>

<p class='c006'>And there was no bread in all the land; for the
famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and
all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found
in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for
the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought
the money into Pharaoh’s house. When all their
money was spent they brought their cattle unto
Joseph, and he gave them bread in exchange for
horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the
herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread
for all their cattle for that year. After this, Joseph
bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine
prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s.
And as for the people, he removed them to cities
from one end of the borders of Egypt, even to the
other end thereof. Only the land of the priests
bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned
them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which
Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their
lands.</p>

<p class='c006'>During these seven years of famine the Egyptians
sold all they had, and that being insufficient
they sold themselves, so that from subjects they
became servants to Pharaoh. Joseph again showed
his forethought and discretion, and called the people
and said to them, Behold, I have bought you this
day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for
you, and you shall sow the land. And it shall come
to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth
part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own,
for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them
of your households, and for food for your little ones.
Thus they became serfs. The wretchedness and
poverty of the people was complete; as if the curse
of Noah on his son Ham was accomplished to the
letter.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this Jacob died, and his sons buried him in
great state in the cave of the field of Machpelah,
which Abraham bought with the field for a possession
of a burying-place, in the land of Canaan (1689 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).</p>

<p class='c006'>Joseph had two sons by his wife Asenath. At the
age of one hundred and ten years this remarkable
man died, and they embalmed him, and he was put
in a coffin in Egypt, and afterwards laid in the ground
near the banks of the Nile. And all Egypt wept
for Joseph seventy days, and his brethren mourned
for him seven days, as they did for Jacob his father.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Pharaoh took the dominion in his own hands,
and governed the people wisely and in good faith.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER II.</span><br /> <br />MOSES—THE RECORDER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The narrative in connection with the Storehouses of
the King would be incomplete without a brief survey
of the life of the inspired writer who recorded all
the particulars regarding them; and as almost every
existing religion is derived from his writings, it will
not be deemed superfluous. Moses was born in
1571 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> At this time a proclamation was issued
throughout the land of Egypt, dooming every male
born to the Hebrews to immediate destruction. The
elders and wise men advised the King to do this,
because they feared that a war might come upon
them, and they feared that the Israelites might so
increase and spread in the land that they might drive
them away from their own country. At first they
gave the Israelites hard work to reduce their numbers,
but, as that was unavailing, they advised the
King, who did not know Joseph, nor remember all
the good that he had done for the Egyptians, to
adopt this barbarous method of reducing the
numbers of the Israelitish inhabitants of Goshen.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was foretold to Amram, a descendant of Levi,
the son of Jacob, that the child, out of dread of whose
nativity the Egyptians had doomed the Israelite
children to destruction, should be his, and be concealed
from those who watched to destroy him; and
having been brought up in a surprising way, he
should deliver the Hebrew nation from the distress
they were under from the Egyptians. His memory
should be famous while the world lasts; and this not
only among the Hebrews, but foreigners also; and that
this child should also have such a brother that he
would himself obtain God’s Priesthood, and his posterity
should have it after him to the end of the world.
Amram and his wife Jochebed were in great perplexity,
and fear increased upon them on account
of this prediction. And when the child was born
they nourished him at home privately for three
months. But after that time Amram—fearing he
would be discovered, and, by falling under the King’s
displeasure, both he and his child would perish, and
so he should make the promise of God of none effect—determined
rather to entrust the safety and care
of the child to God, than to depend on his own concealment
of him, which he looked upon as a thing
uncertain, and whereby both the child, so privately
to be nourished, and himself should be in imminent
danger; but he believed that God would in some
way procure the safety of the child, in order to
realise the truth of his own predictions. When they
had thus determined, they made an ark of bulrushes,
after the manner of a cradle, and of a size
sufficiently large for an infant to be laid in without
being too straitened. They then daubed it over
with slime, which would naturally keep the water
from entering between the bulrushes, and put
the infant into it, and setting it afloat upon the river,
they left its preservation to God; so the river received
the child, and carried him along. Now Thermuthis,
the daughter of Pharaoh, was diverting herself
by the banks of the river; and seeing a cradle borne
along by the current, she sent some that could swim,
and bade them bring the cradle to her. When those
that were sent on this errand came to her with the
cradle, and she saw the little child, she was greatly
in love with it, on account of its largeness and
beauty. Thermuthis bade them bring her a woman
that might afford her breast to the child. Now
Miriam, the sister of Moses, was standing near when
this happened, and, when she had this order given
her, she went and brought the mother, and the child
gladly took her breast, and seemed to stick close to
it; and so it was that, at the Queen’s desire, the
nursing of the child was entirely entrusted to its
mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following names were given to Moses by the
different persons interested in him:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Moses, “I have drawn him from out the water,”
by Thermuthis, Pharaoh’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Heber, “Because he was reunited to his family,”
by his father Amram.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yekuthiel, “I hoped in God,” by his mother
Jochebed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yarah, “I went down to the river to watch
him,” by his sister Miriam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Abigedore, “For God had repaired the breach
in the house of Jacob, and the Egyptians
ceased from that time to cast the infants
into the water,” by his brother Aaron.</p>

<p class='c013'>Abi Socho, “For three months he was hidden,”
by his grandfather Caath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shermaiah Ben Nethaniel, “Because in his
day God heard their groaning and delivered
them from their oppressors,” by the children
of Israel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moses became as a son to Thermuthis, the daughter
of Pharaoh, as a child belonging rightly to the
palace of the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first exploit of Moses was as a general of the
Egyptian army, which he led into Ethiopia; he
marched by land, and on the way gave a wonderful
demonstration of his sagacity. The ground was difficult
to be passed over, because of the multitude of
serpents; these it produces in vast numbers, and,
indeed, is singular in some of those species, which
other countries do not breed, and yet such as are
worse than others in power and mischief, possessing
unusual keenness of sight. Some of these serpents
ascend from the ground unseen, and also fly in the
air, and so come upon men unawares, and do them
mischief. Moses invented a wonderful stratagem to
preserve the army safe and without hurt; for he made
baskets, like unto arks, of sedge, and filled them
with ibises, Egyptian birds, and carried them along
with them. These birds are the greatest enemies to
serpents imaginable, for they fly from them when they
come near them, and as they fly they are caught and
devoured by them. As soon, therefore, as Moses
came to the land which bred these serpents, he let
loose the <a id='ibises' name='ibises' />ibises, and by their means repelled the serpentine
kind; using them as his assistants before the
army came upon that ground. When, therefore,
he proceeded thus on his journey he came upon the
Ethiopians before they expected him; and, joining
battle with them, he beat them and overthrew their
cities, and, indeed, made a great slaughter of the
Ethiopians. Moses laid siege to Saba, afterwards
called Meroë, the capital of Ethiopia, a strong city
encompassed by the Nile and by two other rivers,
Astapus and Astaboras, and strongly fortified with
great ramparts, insomuch that when the waters
come with the greatest violence it can never be
overthrown; these ramparts also make it next to
impossible for even such as have crossed over the
rivers to take the city. However, while Moses was
uneasy at the army’s lying idle (for the enemies durst
not come to battle), this accident or incident occurred:
Tharbis, the daughter of the King of Ethiopia,
happened to see Moses as he led the army near the
walls, and fought with great courage, and admiring
the subtlety of his undertakings, and taking him to
be the author of the success of the Egyptians, she
fell deeply in love with him, and sent to him the
most faithful of all her servants to discourse with
him about their marriage. He thereupon accepted
the offer, on condition that she would procure the
delivering up of the city; and gave her the assurance
of an oath to make her his wife, and that when he
had once taken possession of the city he would not
break his oath to her. No sooner was the agreement
made than its condition was fulfilled; and when Moses
had cut off the Ethiopians he gave thanks to God,
and consummated his marriage, and led the Egyptians
back to their own land.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Now the Egyptians, after they had been preserved by
Moses, entertained a hatred to him, and were very eager
in compassing their designs against him, suspecting
that he would take occasion, from his great success,
to raise a sedition and bring innovations into Egypt;
so they told the King he ought to be slain. The King
had also some intentions of his own to the same purpose;
and, being instigated by the elders and wise
men, he was ready to undertake to kill Moses. But
when Moses learned this he went away privately and
joined the army of Kikanus, the King of Ethiopia,
at that time suppressing a rebellion in Assyria, and
soon became a great favourite with the King and
with all his companions. Then Kikanus became sick
and died in Ethiopia, and his soldiers buried him and
reared a monument over his remains, inscribing upon
it the memorable deeds of his life. After the death of
King Kikanus the army appointed Moses to be their
King and leader. This took place in the hundred and
fifty-seventh year after Israel went down into Egypt.
The Ethiopians placed Moses upon their throne
and set the crown of state upon his head, and they
gave him the widow of Kikanus for a wife; but the
widow of Kikanus was a wife to Moses in name only.
When Moses was made King of Ethiopia the Assyrians
again rebelled as they had done before; but Moses
subdued them and placed them under yearly tribute
to the Ethiopian dynasty. Moses reigned in Ethiopia
in justice and righteousness. But the dowager
Queen of Ethiopia, Adonith, who was a wife to
Moses in name only, said to the people: “Why should
this stranger continue to rule over you? Would it
not be more just to place the son of Kikanus upon
his father’s throne, for he is one of you?” The
people, however, would not vex Moses, whom they
loved, by such a proposition; but Moses voluntarily
resigned the power which they had given him, and
departed from their land. And the people of Ethiopia
made him many rich presents, and dismissed him
with great honours.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Moses being still fearful of
returning to Egypt, travelled towards Midian, and
sat there to rest by a well of water. And the seven
daughters of Jethro, the priest of Midian, came there
and drew water and filled the troughs to water their
father’s flock; and Moses helped them, and at the
invitation of their father he dwelt with them, and
married Zipporah, one of his daughters.</p>

<p class='c006'>And in process of time the King of Egypt died,
and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the
bondage; and God sent Moses to them to deliver
them. After the enthronement of the next King,
Moses and his brother Aaron came before Pharaoh and
asked permission for the Israelites to leave Goshen
on a three days’ journey into the wilderness, to hold
a religious festival unto the Lord their God. But
Pharaoh refused; and thereupon Moses and Aaron
showed miraculous signs and deeds. Still the King
persisted in his refusal; till at last the anger of the
Lord became great towards Pharaoh. God then commanded
Moses and Aaron to prepare the Passover
sacrifice, saying: “I will pass over the land of Egypt
and slay the first-born, both of man and beast.” The
Israelites did as they were commanded, and at midnight
the angel of the Lord passed over the land and
smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast.
Then there was a great and grievous cry through all
the land, for there was not a house without its
dead; and Pharaoh and his people rose up in alarm
and consuming grief, and called for Moses and Aaron
and bade them be gone, supposing that, if once the
Hebrews were gone out of the country, Egypt would
be freed from its miseries. They also gave the
Israelites gifts, some in order to get them to depart
quickly, and others on account of their neighbourhood,
and the friendship they had with them.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>So the Hebrews went out of Egypt, while the
Egyptians wept, and repented that they had treated
them so hardly. And Moses took the bones of Joseph,
the builder of the Storehouses of the King, with him;
for Joseph had strictly sworn the children of Israel,
saying: “God will surely visit you; and ye shall
carry up my bones away hence with you.” And
they took their journey from Goshen, and encamped
in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
This was in the eightieth year of the age of Moses,
and the eighty-third of his brother Aaron.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the King soon regretted that he had let the
Hebrews depart, so he resolved to go after them to
bring them back. Accordingly he pursued after
them with six hundred chariots, fifty thousand horsemen,
and two hundred thousand footmen, all armed.
On coming up to the Hebrews they seized on the
passages by which they imagined the Hebrews might
fly, shutting them up between precipices and the
sea; for there was on each side a ridge of mountains
that terminated at the sea, which were impassable by
reason of their roughness, and obstructed their flight.
Wherefore they were in great distress, as they had
no weapons of war for defence, nor was there a way
of escape. So there was sorrow and lamentation
among the women and children, who had nothing
but destruction before their eyes, being encompassed
with mountains, the sea, and their enemies, and discerned
no way of flying from them.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this juncture Moses called all the people, and
when they were ready he stood on the sea-shore and
prayed to God in these words: “Thou art not
ignorant, O Lord, that it is beyond human strength
and human contrivance to avoid the difficulties which
we are now under; but it must be Thy work altogether
to procure deliverance to this army, which has left
Egypt at Thy appointment. We despair of any other
assistance or contrivance, and have recourse only to
that hope we have in Thee; and if there be any
method that can promise us an escape by Thy providence,
we look up to Thee for it. And let it come
quickly, and manifest Thy power to us; and do Thou
raise up this people to good courage and hope of
deliverance, who are deeply sunk into a disconsolate
state of mind. We are in a helpless place, but still
it is a place that Thou possessest; still the sea is
Thine, the mountains also that enclose us are Thine,
so that these mountains will open themselves if Thou
commandest them; and the sea also, if Thou commandest
it, will become dry land. Nay, we might
escape by a flight through the air, if thou shouldst determine
we should have that way of salvation.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a> When
he ended his prayer, Moses lifted up his hand and
smote the sea with his rod, which parted asunder at
the stroke, and, receding, left the ground dry, as a
road and a place of flight for the Hebrews. Seeing
the assistance of the Almighty thus vouchsafed in
answer to his prayer, he entered in first, and made
the Hebrews follow him; they obeyed and went on
earnestly, as led by God’s presence. The Egyptians
supposed at first that they were distracted, and were
going rashly upon manifest destruction. But when
they saw that they were going a great way without
any harm, and that no obstacle or difficulty fell in
their journey, they made haste to pursue them,
hoping that the sea would be calm for them also.
They put their horse foremost, and went down themselves
into the sea. By this time the Hebrews had
got over to the land on the opposite side without any
hurt. Whence the others were encouraged, and
more courageously pursued them, as hoping no harm
would come to them; but they were mistaken, for as
soon as ever the whole Egyptian army was within it,
the sea flowed to its own place, and came down with
a torrent raised by storms of wind, and encompassed
the Egyptians. Showers of rain also came down
from the sky, and dreadful thunder and lightning,
with flashes of fire. Thunderbolts also were darted
upon them; nor was there anything which used to be
sent by God upon men as indications of His wrath
which did not happen at this time, for a dark and
dismal night oppressed them. And thus did the
King of Egypt and all his men perish, so that there
was not one man left to be a messenger of this
calamity to the rest of the Egyptians.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a> On the next
day Moses gathered together the weapons of the
Egyptians, which were brought on shore by the
current of the sea, the force of the winds assisting
it; and he armed the Hebrews with them.
After returning grateful thanks for this miraculous
deliverance, he led the people to Mount Sinai, as
he was ordered by God beforehand. Here he instructed
them, and prepared them against the time
when they should enter the land of Canaan, which
country they considered their inheritance, and to
which they looked as the destination of their journey.
And Moses gave them, among other lessons, the Ten
Commandments, which were engraved upon two
stone slabs or tables, five on each table, and two and
a half upon each side of them. The First Commandment
taught that there is but one God, and that they
ought to worship Him only; the Second commanded
them not to make the image of any living creature,
to worship it; the Third, that they must not swear
by God in a false matter; the Fourth that they must
keep the seventh day, by resting from all sorts of
work; the Fifth, that they must honour their
parents; the Sixth, that they must abstain from
murder; the Seventh, that they must not commit
adultery; the Eighth, that they must not be guilty
of theft; the Ninth, that they must not bear false witness;
the Tenth, that they must not admit the desire
of anything that is another’s.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a> These two tables were,
for security, placed in a box or ark, made of wood
that was naturally strong and could not be corrupted.
This ark was called, in the Hebrew language, Eron.
Its construction was thus: its length was five spans,
but its breadth and height were, each of them, three
spans. It was covered all over with gold, both within
and without, so that the wooden part was not seen.
It had also a cover united to it by golden hinges
in a wonderful manner; which cover was every
way evenly fitted to it, and had no irregularities to
hinder its exact conjunction. There were also two
golden rings fastened to each of the longer boards,
and passing right through the wood; through them
gilt bars passed along each board, that it might
thereby be moved and carried about as occasion
should require; for it was not drawn in a cart
by beasts of burden, but borne on the shoulders of
the priests. Upon this cover were two images, which
the Hebrews call cherubims; they are flying creatures,
but their form is not like to that of any of the creatures
which men have seen, though Moses said he had
seen such beings near the throne of God.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c007'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As the people were dwelling in tents, and were
marching towards the land of Canaan by easy
marches, Moses made a tent called the Tabernacle,
in which he placed the ark containing the two tables.
This Tabernacle served as a church in the wilderness,
and wherever they travelled they carried it about
with them. Moses appointed his brother Aaron to
be the High Priest; and after the death of Aaron,
Eleazar, his son, became his successor, and the garments
of his high office were put upon him. The
family of the Levites were the priests.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moses remained with the Hebrews forty years, and
laboured to make them a religious and God-fearing
people; but they frequently revolted against him,
murmuring whenever they were in distress, and tried
his patience to the utmost, till he forgot himself, and
also complained against God, for which he was forbidden
to enter the land of Canaan. Therefore, when
he had admonished and repeated to the people
all the laws he had given them, he brought them
to the border of Canaan, and gave over the
charge of the Hebrews to Joshua, his disciple and
their commander. Now, as Moses went from them
to the place where he wished to vanish out of their
sight, they all followed after him weeping; but he
beckoned with his hand to those that were remote
from him, and bade them stay behind in quiet, while
he exhorted those that were near him that they
would not mourn so at his departure. Whereupon
they thought they ought to grant him that favour, to
let him depart according as he himself desired; so
they restrained themselves, though weeping still
towards one another. All those who accompanied
him were the Senate, and Eleazar the High Priest,
and Joshua, their commander. Now as soon as they
were come to the mountain called Abarim (which is
a very high mountain, situate over against Jericho,
and one that affords, to such as are upon it, a prospect
of the greatest part of the excellent land of Canaan), he
dismissed the Senate; and, as he was going to embrace
Eleazar and Joshua, and was still discoursing with
them, suddenly a cloud stood over him, and he disappeared
in a certain valley out of their sight.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when
he left the camp of the Israelites. He spent forty
years of his life in teaching the Laws of God to the
people in the wilderness. He was one that exceeded
all men that ever were in understanding, and made
the best use of what that understanding suggested
to him. He had a very graceful way of speaking and
addressing himself to the multitude; and as to his
other qualifications, he had such a full command of
his passions, as if he had hardly any such in his
soul, and only knew them by their names, as rather
perceiving them in other men than in himself. He
was also such a general of an army as is seldom
seen, as well as a king and a prophet as was never
known, and this to such a degree, that whatsoever he
pronounced one would think he heard the voice of
God Himself. So the people mourned for him thirty
days, nor did any grief so deeply affect the Hebrews
as did this upon the departure of Moses; nor were
those who had witnessed his conduct the only persons
who desired him, but those also who perused the
laws he left behind him greatly longed for him, and
from those laws learned the extraordinary virtue he
was master of.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a> At this period of his life his eye
was not dim, nor his natural force abated. “And
Joshua, the son of Nun, was full of the spirit of wisdom,
for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and
the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as
the Lord commanded Moses. And there arose not a
prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the
Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the
wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land
of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to
all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all
the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of
all Israel.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Although he wrote in the holy books that
he died, it was for fear lest they should say that,
because of his extraordinary virtue, he went to God.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Moses was as we shall see, a great traveller, and
acquainted with the vast wilderness that extends
from the centre of Africa to the jungles of Bengal,
that consists of rugged mountains and of sandy
wastes; it was traversed by three river-basins or
valley plains. In its centre was the basin of the
Tigris and Euphrates. On its east was the basin of
the Indus; on its west was the basin of the Nile.
Each of these river systems was enclosed by deserts;
the whole region resembling a broad yellow field
with three green streaks running north and south.
The inhabitants of these regions were not in the
habit of travelling beyond the confines of their own
valleys. They resembled islanders, and they had no
ships. But the intermediate seas were navigated by
the wandering tribes, who sometimes pastured their
flocks by the waters of the Indus, sometimes by the
waters of the Nile. It was by their means that the
trade between the river-lands was carried on. They
possessed the camels and other beasts of burden requisite
for the transport of goods. Their numbers and
their warlike habits, their intimate acquaintance with
the watering-places and seasons of the desert, enabled
them to carry the goods in safety through a dangerous
land; while the regular profits they derived from
the trade, and the oaths by which they were bound,
induced them to act fairly to those by whom they
were employed. At this time, 1451 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, a mighty
tide of the Aryans immigrated to the basin or valley
plain of the Indus. They called themselves Arya, or
noble, and spoke a language the common source of
Sanskrit, Prakrit, Zand, Persian, and Armenian in
Asia. They settled down as agriculturists in the
districts surrounding the Indus, their wealth consisting
of flocks and herds; thence, after a time, they
overran by successive irruptions the plains of the
Ganges, and spread themselves over the regions
called Aryavarta, occupying the whole of Central
India. They were the promoters of the moral and
intellectual progress and civilization in India; and
notwithstanding all the diversities of the Hindoo
populations throughout India, their religious faith has
been preserved in their one language and one literature,
furnishing a good evidence of the original unity
of the Indo-Aryans. Their leader and legislator was
known by the name of Manu, who was no other than
Moses. After leaving the camp of the Israelites he
travelled to the Indus; the form of Government he
established there was the counterpart or duplicate of
the one he established among the Hebrews; the laws
and customs were the very same; the most careful
comparison will confirm the fact. Moses was afraid
that the Hebrews would trace his footsteps, so he
sank his identity by assuming a foreign name: thus,
for Moses he used Manu; for Abraham, Brahman;
for Amram, Ram. All the remarkable Biblical
events are familiar to the Brahmans, and the record
of the creation as contained in the Bible was given
in the Rig-veda of the Hindoos. The narrative of
the finding of Moses by the daughter of Pharaoh
has a corresponding record, but as he was more than
one hundred and twenty years old when he arrived
in India, the account is that the Lawgiver was cradled
by a large sea-serpent on the bosom of the great
waters for ages, whilst he was in a state of somnolence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The origin of the belief in the Transmigration of
the Soul is also taken from an event in the life of
Moses, which is recorded in the Hebrew Talmud
thus: The Lord said to Moses, “Behold, thy days
approach that thou must die.” On this Moses
thought that he had committed but a slight offence,
which would be pardoned; for ten times had Israel
tempted God’s wrath and been forgiven through his
intercession, as it is written: “And the Lord said, I
have pardoned according to thy word.” But when
he became convinced that he would not be pardoned,
he made the following supplication: “Sovereign of
the universe, my trouble and my exertion for Israel’s
sake is revealed and known before Thee. How I
have laboured to cause thy people to know Thee,
and to believe in Thy Holy Name, and practise Thy
holy law, has come before Thee. O Lord, as I had
shared their trouble and their distress, I hoped to
share their happiness. Behold, now, the time has
come when their trials will cease, when they will
enter into the land of promised bliss, and Thou sayest
to me, Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan. O
Eternal, great and just, if thou wilt not allow me to
enter into this goodly land, permit me at least to
live on here in this world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then God answered Moses, saying: “If thou wilt
not die in this world, how canst thou live in the world
to come?” But Moses continued: “If thou wilt not
permit me to pass over this Jordan, let me live as
the beasts of the field; they eat of the herbs and drink
of the waters, and live and see the world; let my
life be even as theirs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And God answered: “Let it suffice thee; do not
continue to speak unto me any more on this matter.”
Yet again Moses prayed: “Let me live even as the
fowls; they gather their food in the morning, and in
the evening they return unto their nests. Let my
life be even as theirs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And again God said: “Let it suffice thee; do not
continue to speak to me any more on this matter.”
Then Moses proclaimed: “He is the Rock; His
work is perfect, and His ways are just; the God of
Truth, just and upright is He.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The Persians, known in India as Parsees, are worshippers
of the element of fire. This fire-worship
originated from an event that took place in Persia
when the Hebrews were captives in that country.
The King of Persia gave the Hebrews leave to
sacrifice to the Lord as Moses had commanded them;
and when the prophet Nehemiah had prepared the
sacrifice, the priests and the Israelites offered up this
prayer: “O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things,
Who art fearful and strong, and righteous and merciful,
and the only and gracious King, the only giver
of all things, the only just, almighty, and everlasting,
Thou that deliverest Israel from all trouble, and didst
choose the fathers, and sanctify them: Receive the
sacrifice for Thy whole people Israel, and preserve
Thine own portion, and sanctify it. Gather those together
that are scattered from us, deliver them that
serve among the heathen, look upon them that are
despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that
Thou art our God. Punish them that oppress us, and
with pride do us wrong. Plant Thy people again in
Thy holy place, as Moses hath spoken.” And the
priests sang psalms of thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now when the sacrifice was consumed, Nehemiah
commanded the water that was left to be poured on
the great stones. When this was done, there was
kindled a flame; but it was consumed by the light
that shined from the altar. So when this matter was
known, it was told the King of Persia that, in the
place where the priests that were led away had hid
the fire, there appeared water, and that Nehemiah
had purified the sacrifices therewith. Then the King,
inclosing the place, made it holy, after he had tried
the matter and convinced himself of the fact.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The Mohammedans are the followers of Mohammed,
and the Koran that he gave them, he told his
followers, “is not a new invented fiction, but a confirmation
of those Scriptures which have been revealed
to Moses before it, and a distinct explication of everything
necessary in respect either to faith or practice,
and a direction and mercy unto people who believe.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c007'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As for the Israelites, though they are now scattered
over the face of the whole earth, yet the Tabernacle,
and the Altar of Incense, and the Ark containing the
two Stone Tables on which were engraven the Ten
Commandments given by God, by the hand of Moses,
are still in Mount Abarim, hidden there by Jeremiah
the prophet, before the sack and burning of the
Temple of Solomon by the Babylonians. They are in
a cave, wherein Jeremiah laid them and stopped
the door, saying, “As for that place, it shall be
unknown until the time that God gather his people
again together, and receive them unto mercy. Then
shall the Lord show them these things, and the glory
of the Lord shall appear, and the cloud also, as it was
showed under Moses, and as when Solomon desired
that the place might be honourably sanctified.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c007'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>After the departure of the Israelites from the land
of Egypt, that country was reduced to the lowest
depth of misery. The King, with all his chariots,
horsemen, and footmen were all overwhelmed and
destroyed; there was no firstborn of man (or beast)
to mourn the loss of their kindred. The land was
desolate, and the Storehouses of the King stood out
in their grandeur to remind the survivors of their
ingratitude to the relatives of the man who built them,
to preserve the Egyptians during the seven years of
the grievous famine that afflicted the land of Egypt.
They must have avoided the sight of these monuments,
thereby to forget the misery and desolation
they had brought on themselves by their cruel treatment
of the Hebrews. The Egyptian priests knew
what these buildings were, for they were the historians
of their country; but when Herodotus visited
Egypt and made minute inquiries regarding the
Pyramids, they gave him a confused account, telling
him, however, that for one hundred and six years
the Egyptians suffered all kinds of calamities, and
that for this length of time the temples were closed
and never opened. From the hatred they bore them,
the Egyptians were not willing to mention the names
of their kings, but called the large Pyramids after
Philition (Zaphnath-paaneah, Psothom Phanech), a
shepherd who at that time kept his cattle in those
parts.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Philition is a corruption of the other two
names given to Joseph by Pharaoh; while the
shepherds were the brothers of Joseph, and Goshen—Gizeh
of our time—the region where they dwelt,
as commanded by the King. The Greeks could
make nothing out of the information gathered by
Herodotus.</p>

<p class='c006'>In course of time the first Republic of France sent
a traveller into Upper and Lower Egypt, and the
inhabitants of the land of Egypt had so far forgotten
the events of the past that they showed him an
enclosed space as the granaries of Joseph. The
traveller says: “You see at ancient Cairo the granaries
of Joseph, if the name of granaries can with
propriety be given to a vast space of ground surrounded
with walls twenty feet in height, and divided
into a sort of courts which have no roof, or any other
covering whatever, in which are deposited the grains
brought out of Upper Egypt for the revenue, where
they are the food of a multitude of birds, and the
receptacle of their ordure. The walls of this enclosure
are of a bad construction; they have nothing in their
appearance which announces an ancient building, and
the love of the marvellous alone could have attributed
its elevation to the patriarch Joseph.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The French
Government gained nothing, and its attention was
diverted from the Storehouses of the King. Since
that time many explorers have gone to the Pyramids,
and spent princely fortunes in trying to solve the
mystery as to what they were and who built them.
But the Arabs are too cunning and too indolent to
tell the truth; for they know from experience that,
if the truth were known, they would be made to
assist in repairing the Storehouses of the King, just
as many of the people were set to cut the Suez
Canal, when the French discovered an old undertaking
of the reign of Necho, which had been left
unfinished because the oracle declared that the king
was making the canal for a barbarian. Wherefore
the Arabs reckon that, ignoring all knowledge,
they gain a good livelihood as guides, by taking
travellers to the Pyramids, which is little trouble to
them, but brings them “plenty backsheesh.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER III.</span><br /> <br />TOWER OF BABEL—THE MODEL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Pyramids were, without doubt, copied from and
built after the model of the Tower of Babel. At
the time that Joseph was entrusted by Pharaoh with
the task of making provision against the approaching
famine that he predicted would take place, the building
of the City and Tower of Babel by Nimrod the
son of Cush, the son of Ham, the son of Noah, and
the confusion of tongues that followed, were of comparatively
recent date. Abraham’s father Terah was
in the service of King Nimrod during their erection.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are told in the Scriptures that “the whole
earth was of one language and of one speech. And
it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they
dwelt there. And they said one to another, Go to,
let us make brick, and burn them <a id='thoroughly' name='thoroughly' />thoroughly. And
they had brick for stone, and slime had they for
mortar. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city
and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and
let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad
upon the face of the whole earth.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In this description the motive assigned for the
building of the above-mentioned city and tower is
that the people over whom Nimrod reigned might be
preserved together with renown. They found a
plain by the river Euphrates that suited their purpose,
resembling the plain of Egypt by the river
Nile. In Shinar there was no stone, so brick was
used in its stead. This plain was fertile and produced
much corn. The settlers anticipated another Deluge,
and on that account they provided themselves with
the means of subsistence when that calamity might
recur on the earth. The precaution they took for
this event was to build a place of safety, with a
granary that would hold a sufficient amount of corn
to last during the whole period of the visitation.
They built a gigantic granary resembling the great
Pyramid of Jeezeh, which they filled with corn.
Joseph imitated this example in Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same event is thus recorded in the Talmud:—“Cush,
the son of Ham and grandson of Noah,
married in his old age a young wife, and begat a son,
whom he called Nimrod, because in those days the
people were beginning to rebel again against the
Lord’s command, and Nimrod signifies ‘Rebellion.’
Now Nimrod grew up, and his father loved him exceedingly,
because he was the child of his old age.
When Nimrod was forty years old his brethren, the
sons of Ham, quarrelled with the sons of Japhet.
And Nimrod assembled the tribe of Cush, and went
forth to battle with the sons of Japhet. And he
addressed his army, saying, ‘Be not dismayed, and
banish fear from your hearts. Our enemies shall
surely be your booty, and ye shall do with them as
ye please.’ Nimrod was victorious, and the opposing
armies became his subjects. And when he and his
soldiers returned home rejoicing, the people gathered
around and made him king, and placed a crown upon
his head. And he appointed counsellors, judges,
chiefs, generals, and captains. He established a
national government, and he made Therach, the son
of Nahor, his chief officer. When Nimrod had thus
established his power he decided to build a city, a
walled town, which should be the capital of his
country. And he selected a certain plain and built
a large city thereon, and called it Shinar. And
Nimrod dwelt in Shinar in safety, and gradually
became ruler over all the world; and at that time all
the people of the earth were of one language and
of one speech. Nimrod in his prosperity did not
regard the Lord. He made gods of wood and
stone, and the people copied his doings. His son
Mordan served idols also, from which we have, even
to this day, the proverb, ‘From the wicked wickedness
comes forth.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“And it came to pass about this time that the
officers of Nimrod and the descendants of Phut,
Mitzrayim, Cush, and Canaan took counsel together,
and they said to one another, ‘Let us build a city,
and also in its midst a tall tower for a stronghold, a
tower the top of which shall reach even to the
heavens. Then shall we truly make for ourselves a
great and mighty name, before which all our enemies
shall tremble. None will then be able to harm us,
and no wars may disperse our ranks.’ And they
spoke these words to the King, and he approved of
their design. Therefore these families gathered together
and selected a suitable spot for their city and
its tower on a plain towards the east in the land of
Shinar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And while they were building rebellion budded
in their hearts, rebellion against God, and they imagined
that they could scale the heavens and war with
Him. They divided into three parties. The first
party said, ‘We will ascend to heaven and place there
our gods and worship them.’ The second party said,
‘We will pour into the heavens of the Lord and
match our strength with His.’ And the third party
said, ‘Yea, we will smite Him with arrow and with
spear.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“And God watched their evil enterprise and knew
their thoughts, yet they builded on. If one of the
stones which they had raised to its height fell, they
were sad at heart, and even wept; yet when any of
their brethren fell from the building and were killed,
none took account of the life thus lost. Thus they
continued for a space of years, till God said, ‘We
will confuse their language.’ Then the people forgot
their language, and they spoke to one another in a
strange tongue. And they quarrelled and fought on
account of the many misunderstandings occasioned
by this confusion of language, and many were
destroyed in these quarrels, till at last they were
compelled to cease building.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The tower was exceedingly tall. The third part
of it sank down into the ground, a second third was
burned down, but the remaining third was standing
until the time of the destruction of Babylon. Thus
were the people dispersed over the globe, and divided
into nations.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In this narrative the object of these wicked
idolaters was to ascend and carry war into heaven
against God. To accomplish this object or design
they built the city and tower; the latter served for
the granary as well as the stronghold of the new
city.</p>

<p class='c006'>Abraham was born about this time. His father
Terah was then in the service of King Nimrod, in
Babylon. Owing to the idolatry and the wickedness
of the people, Abraham left the country with his
wife and nephew, and settled in the land of Canaan.
When Joseph was a child he must have heard from
his father the story of those eventful times, when
Abraham dwelt in the country wherein he was born.
In due time he availed himself of the knowledge thus
imparted to him in his early days.</p>

<p class='c006'>Modern travellers have found many remains of
Pyramids in the ancient kingdom of Babylonia.
There was, therefore, nothing new or wonderful in the
fact of Joseph erecting granaries throughout Egypt
when a severe famine was expected. These granaries
or Pyramids began in the Delta, which was most
fertile and yielded the largest amount of corn. The
Pyramids here are the finest as well as the largest;
the rest are erected along the western shore of the Nile
as far as Ethiopia, which was a province of Egypt.
This province revolted in the lifetime of Moses. He
went there as commander of the Egyptian forces and
suppressed the rebellion. The ruins in Meroë and
Axum, and other places in Ethiopia, attest the truth
of this statement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Egyptologists have spent much time and labour
in pursuit of their science, but, very unfortunately,
their researches have been directed by misleading
guides.</p>

<p class='c006'>The authorities they took for their guidance were
the Greek and Roman writers, who knew nothing
about the events that took place before Egypt became
a province of Alexander the Great and of the emperors
of Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'>The oldest and best records of Egypt and the
ancient world were written by the inspired historian
Moses, and these records, or a small portion of them,
were translated from the Hebrew into the Greek
language by seventy Jewish elders for the King
Ptolemy Philadelphus in the year 284 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; so that
before this time the outer or the Gentile world was
in utter ignorance regarding the history of Egypt,
as well as that of the Jews. The authors held in
veneration by Egyptologists are Manetho and Herodotus.
Manetho’s ignorance as to the history of his
own country is shown by Flavius Josephus; and
Herodotus wrote his account of the Pyramids from
hearsay. The priests who related the anecdotes concerning
the kings Cheops and his brother Chephren,
and the shepherd Philition, knew nothing themselves
as to the real truth, for the whole account is in
confusion, worse confounded by their stupendous
ignorance.</p>

<p class='c006'>The writings of these two authors have misled
every Egyptologist. Had the Bible, the Jewish
records called the Talmud, and Flavius Josephus
been studied instead, Egyptologists would have learnt
the truth, and nothing but the truth, and their time
and labour would have been rewarded most satisfactorily.
The reader of this work will find extracts
in the later portion of it, which will repay the trouble
of perusal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The testimony of recent travellers proves the
reality of the existence of granaries in Babylon, and
the indisputable fact that the Pyramids were built in
imitation of them. The following is an instance:—<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“On the 9th December 1811 Mr. Rich made an
expedition to the Birs-i-Nimrúd. He found vestiges
of mounds all round it to a considerable extent, and
the country traversed by canals in every direction.
The soil round it is sandy. Close to the Birs, or at
about a hundred yards from it, and parallel with its
southern front, is a high mound, almost equal in size
to that of the Kasr.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘The Birs,’ says he, ‘is an enormous mound.
At the north end it rises, and there is an immense
brick wall, thirty-seven feet high and twenty-eight
in breadth, upon it. This wall is not in the centre
of the north summit of the mound, but appears to
have formed the southern face of it. The other parts
of the summit are covered by huge fragments of
brickwork, tumbled confusedly together; and what
is most extraordinary is that they are partly converted
into a solid vitrified mass. The layers are in
many parts perfectly distinguishable; but the whole
of these lumps seem to have undergone the action of
fire. Several lumps of the same matter have rolled
down, and remain partly on the side of the mound
and partly in the plain. The large wall on the
southern face of the summit is built of burnt bricks,
with writing on them, and so close together that no
cement is discoverable between the layers. Small
square apertures are left, which go quite through the
building, and are arranged in a kind of quincunx
form. Down the face of the wall the bricks have
been separated, leaving a large crack. On the side
towards the mound of Ibrahím Khalil, the mound
slopes gradually down, and up nearly half its height
is a flat road running round this part of it, twenty of
my paces broad.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘From this the mound slopes more gradually to
the plain or valley between it and the mound of
Ibrahím Khalil, and is worn into deep ravines or
furrows, like the Mujelibé. On the other or north
face of this pile it slopes down more abruptly at once
into the plain, with only hollows or paths round it,
the road before mentioned, which from that part
appears to surround the building, losing itself before
it reaches this. On the north-west face, where it
also slopes down into the plain, are vestiges of building
in the side, exactly similar in appearance and
construction to the wall on the top, with the holes
or apertures which are mentioned in the description
of that. At foot of all is, seemingly, a flat base of
greater extent, but very little raised above the level of
the plain. The whole sides of the mound are covered
with pieces of brick, both burnt and unburnt, bitumen,
pebbles, spar, black stone, the same sand or limestone
which covers the canal at the Kasr, and even
fragments of white marble. No reeds were to be
seen in any part of the building, though I saw one
or two specimens of burnt bricks which evidently
had reeds in their composition, and some had the
impression of reeds on their cement. I saw also
several bricks which were thickly coated with bitumen
on their lower face. In the lowest part of the
mound opposite Ibrahím Khalil, the mounds are most
evidently composed of unburnt bricks, the layers
being in great measure visible. This would lead one
to suppose that it was not originally part of the great
pile, were not specimens of this kind of bricks found
in it also.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘The circumference of the base—not the low one—is
762 yards. The whole height of it, from this
measured base to the summit of the tower or wall,
is 235 feet; but there can be no doubt that it was
much higher. The form is more oblong than
square. I found the longest side to be 248 of
my paces. Fortunately for the preservation of the
ruin, it is too far from the Euphrates for the Arabs
to think it worth their while to excavate for bricks;
while they are so closely joined together, that it is
impossible to procure them quite unbroken.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Rich will not admit this tower to be that of
Belus, because, according to his view, it is on the
wrong side of the river.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The whole height of the Birs-i-Nimrúd above
the plain to the summit of the brick wall is 235
feet. The brick wall itself, which stands on the
edge of the summit, and was undoubtedly the face of
another stage, is 37 feet high. In the side of the
pile, a little below its summit, is very clearly to be
seen part of another brick wall, precisely resembling
the fragment which crowns the summit, and still
encasing and supporting its part of the mound.
This is clearly indicative of another stage of greater
extent.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Without forming any conjecture as to what
might have been its original construction, the
impression made by the sight of it is, that it was
a solid pile, composed in the interior of unburnt
brick, and perhaps earth or rubbish; that it was
constructed in receding stages, and faced with kiln-burnt
bricks having inscriptions on them, laid in a
very thin layer of lime cement; and that it was
reduced by violence to its present ruinous condition.
The upper stones have been forcibly broken down,
and fire has been employed as an implement of
destruction, though it is not easy to say how or why.
The facing of fine bricks has been partly removed
and partly covered by the falling down of the mass
which it supported and kept together.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A still later traveller, Mr. Buckingham, is of
opinion that the traces of four stages are clearly
discernible.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As to Major Rennell’s doubt whether the ruin
was artificial, Mr. Rich observes that, ‘so indisputably
evident is the fact of the whole mass being
from top to bottom artificial, that he should as soon
have thought of writing a dissertation to prove that
the Pyramids are the work of human hands as of
dwelling upon this point. The Birs-i-Nimrúd,’ he
adds, ‘is, in all likelihood, at present nearly in the
state in which Alexander saw it, if we give any credit
to the report that ten thousand men could only
remove the rubbish, preparatory to repairing it, in
two months. If, indeed, it required one half of that
number to disencumber it, the state of dilapidation
must have been complete.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘The immense masses of vitrified brick which
are seen on the top of the mound appear to have
marked its summit since the time of its destruction.
The rubbish about its base was probably in much
greater quantities, the weather having dissipated
much of it in the course of so many revolving ages;
and possibly portions of the interior facing of fine
brick may have disappeared at different periods.’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER IV.</span><br /> <br />THE PYRAMIDS AS GRANARIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The land of Shinar, with its desolate tower, the
marvellous prototype of the Great Pyramid of
Jeezeh, passed from one conqueror to another; and
when the descendants of the Prophet Mohammed
became rulers of the east and west, the Caliph Al
Mamoun, in the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 820, came from Bagdad
to El Fostat, an earlier Cairo, and determined to
enter the largest Pyramid and examine its contents,
for he believed from the reports brought to him that
it contained untold treasures. He ordered his Mohammedan
workmen to begin at the middle of the
northern side of the Great Pyramid. These men
worked on unceasingly by night and by day. Weeks
and months were consumed in these toilsome exertions;
so persevering, however, were they, that,
though progressing slowly, they at length penetrated
no less than one hundred feet in depth
from the entrance. By that time, they were becoming
thoroughly exhausted, and began to despair
of the hard and hitherto fruitless labour, when one
day they heard a great stone fall evidently in some
hollow space within not more than a few feet on one
side of them. In the fall of that particular stone
there seems to have been somewhat more than an
accident.</p>

<p class='c006'>They instantly pushed on in the direction of the
strange noise. Breaking through a wall surface,
they burst into the hollow way, very dark and
dreadful to look at, and difficult to pass. It was
the inclined and descending entrance-passage of the
Pyramid, where the Romans and others passed up
and down in their occasional visits to the subterranean
chamber and its unfinished, unquarried-out
floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>A large angular-fitting stone, that had been for
ages, with its lower flat side, a smooth and polished
portion of the ceiling of the inclined and narrow
entrance-passage, quite undistinguishable from any
other part of the whole of its line, had now dropped
on to the floor before their eyes, and revealed that
there was just behind it the end of another passage,
clearly ascending therefrom towards the south. That
ascending passage itself was still closed a little
further up by a portcullis or stopper, formed by a
series of huge granite plugs, of square wedge-like
shape, dropped or slid down, and then jammed in
immovably from above. To break this in pieces
within the confined space, and pull out the fragments
there, was entirely out of the question; so the workmen
broke through the smaller ordinary masonry,
and thus up again by a huge chasm—still visible, and
used by visitors into the interior—to the ascending
passage, at a point past the terrific hardness of its
lower granite obstruction. They found up there
beyond the portcullis the passage-way still blocked,
but the filling material at that part was only limestone;
so, making themselves a very great hole in
the masonry along the western side, they there
wielded their tools on the long blocks which presented
themselves to their view. But as fast as they
broke up and pulled out the pieces of one of the
blocks in this ascending passage, other blocks, also
of such a size as to completely fill it, slid down from
above, and where there should have been free passage
there was still an obstruction of solid stone. The
men despair; but the Caliph, being present, insists
that, whatever the number of stone plugs still to
come down from the mysterious reservoir, his men
shall hammer and hammer them, one after the other,
and bit by bit, to little pieces, at the only opening
where they can get at them, until they at last come
to the end. So the work goes on, till at length the
ascending passage, beginning just above the granite
portcullis, leading thence upward and to the south,
becomes free from obstruction.</p>

<p class='c006'>On they rush, up one hundred and ten feet of the
steep incline, crouching hands and knees and chin
together, through a passage of polished white limestone,
forty-seven inches in height and forty-one in
breadth. They suddenly emerge into a long high
gallery, all black as night and in death-like silence;
still ascending, they see another low passage. On
their right hand is the dark, ominous-looking mouth
of a deep well, in which not even at a depth of more
than 140 feet is the water reached; while onwards
and above them is a continuation of the gallery
leading them on.</p>

<p class='c006'>The way was narrow, not more than six feet broad
anywhere, and contracted to three feet at the floor,
but twenty feet high, and of polished marble-like
stone throughout. Ascending at an angle of 26°,
these men had to push their dangerous and slippery
way for about a hundred feet still further; then an
obstructing three-foot step to climb over; next a
low doorway; then a hanging portcullis to pass,
almost to creep under; and then another low doorway,
with awful blocks of red granite on either
side, above, and below.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this they leaped without further obstruction
at once into the grand chamber, a right noble apartment
now called the King’s Chamber, about thirty-four
feet long, seventeen broad, and nineteen high, of
polished red granite throughout, in blocks squared
and put together with exquisite skill. In this apartment
they found—nothing, except an empty stone
chest or box or coffer without a lid!<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c007'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The Caliph Al Mamoun was amazed, for he had
arrived at the very furthest part of the interior of
the Great Pyramid he had so long desired to take
possession of, and had now found absolutely nothing
that he could make any use of, or saw the smallest
value in. He returned to El Fostat greatly disappointed,
and the Grand Gallery, the King’s Chamber,
and the stone coffer without a lid were troubled by
him no more; for after this he left Egypt and
returned to his imperial residence in Bagdad, where
he died in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 842.</p>

<p class='c006'>The entrance into the Great Pyramid in use in our
time is the one thus made by this prince. The
granite chest or coffer without a lid, found in the
King’s Chamber above-mentioned, was not a sarcophagus,
or a coffin, but simply a corn measure, and
nothing else, which holds about four English quarters.
It was placed in that chamber by the inspired
builder Joseph, the great-grandson of Abraham the
Hebrew, the friend of God; the Pyramid being a
gigantic granary holding corn, and this the measure
by which he ascertained the quantity stored in it.
The passages in the walls, called air-channels by
Egyptologists, were apertures through which the
corn was thrown from without into the chamber, and
thence into the vast receptacles below. The grain
was brought from the fields to the apertures up the
steps, before the casing-stones were fitted to the whole
edifice, which, being afterwards polished, kept the
contents secure from moth and mildew.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Joseph died “his body was embalmed and
afterwards laid in the ground near the banks of the
Nile.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c007'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The locality that exactly answers this place
of sepulture has been discovered in modern times.
“The structure found there is situated about a thousand
feet south-east of the Pyramid building, and
still to be seen, descended into, and measured, is a
colossally large and deep burial pit, on the square
and level bottom of which rests an antique rude sarcophagus
of very gigantic proportions. But deep as
is the pit containing it, it is surrounded by a grand
rectangular trench which goes down deeper still, cut
clearly in solid limestone rock the whole of the way
down; and to such a depth does it reach at last as
to descend below the level of the adjacent waters of the
Nile at inundation time. Then, as the waters of that
river necessarily percolate the hygroscopic rock of the
hill up to their own level, the lower depths of the
trench are filled with Nile water, and the grand old
sarcophagus of the interior pit does then rest in a
manner on an island surrounded by the waters of the
Nile; and it is the only known tomb on the Jeezeh
hill which is gifted with that peculiarity or privilege.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c007'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This is the tomb of which Herodotus speaks as the
resting-place of the builder of the Great Pyramid,
to whom he gives the names of Chemmis, Cheops,
Xufu, Suphis, Philition the Shepherd, &amp;c. All these
appellations belong to no other person than Zaphnath-paaneah,
the Viceroy of Pharaoh, King of
Egypt, the great-grandson of Abraham the Hebrew,
the friend of God!</p>

<p class='c006'>The sarcophagus is empty, for the bones of Joseph
were carried away by the children of Israel when
they took their departure from Egypt under the
leadership of Moses and Aaron.</p>

<p class='c006'>Visitors who enter the Pyramid get covered with
a fine grey dust or powder similar to that found in
large rooms or buildings wherein grain has been
stored; for any person entering such places, though
emptied of their contents, but left unswept, would
get covered with a grey powder fallen from corn, or
rice, or wheat, &amp;c., which in every respect resembles
this fine grey dust. In confirmation of this the following
is an instance:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Last month (1877) an American newspaper, recounting
a recent visit to the King’s Chamber of the
Great Pyramid, mentions how the clergyman of the
party, the Rev. Dr. ——, insisted on laying himself
down full length inside the coffer. He had heard the
inspiration, and scientific metrological theory of the
Great Pyramid duly related by Dr. Grant, and had
not denied it; but so strongly was he imbued with
the mere tombic idea of the Egyptians, that he held,
as he lay there, with the notion that he was lying
down in a royal coffin; and when he, Dr. ——, rose
up from that open granite chest and found himself
filthy, horrible, odious, with fine grey dust begriming
his hair and transfusing his clothes, he had a great
deal of trouble about it; for not until he had got right
away from Egypt, and obtained the help of the
steward’s assistant on board ship to give the clothes
an extra beating over the waves of the rolling sea,
was the last of the penetrating powdery stuff got rid
of.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c007'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Howard Vyse also found a substance of
this description when he entered the Pyramids, of
which he gave a minute account in his work on the
Pyramids of Egypt. It is as follows:—“For a day
or two after the chamber had been opened those who
remained in it became blackened as if by a London
fog. As this effect gradually disappeared, I conceive
it to have been occasioned by the blasting and by the
sudden admission of the air.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Upon first entering the apartment, a black sediment
was found, of the consistence of a hoar-frost,
equally distributed over the floor, so that footsteps
could be distinctly seen impressed on it, and it had
accumulated to some depth in the interstices of the
blocks. Some of this sediment which was sent to
the French establishment near Cairo was said to contain
ligneous particles. When analysed in England
it was supposed to consist of the exuviæ of insects;
but as the deposition was equally diffused over the
floor, and extremely like the substance found on the
25th instant (1837) at the Second Pyramid, it was
most probably composed of particles of decayed
stone. If it had been the remains of rotten wood,
or of a quantity of insects that had penetrated through
the masonry, it would scarcely have been so equally
distributed; and if caused by the latter, it is difficult
to imagine why some of them should not have been
found alive when the place was opened evidently for
the first time since the Pyramid was built.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Previous to the visitation of the seven years’
famine, these granaries were built and stored, and
the casing-stones fitted with cement and polished,
making these edifices appear like natural rocks.
Bruce, the great traveller, and other old travellers of
those days, mistook them for such (natural rocks)
and paid no attention to them whatever.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the time arrived that the Storehouses of the
King were required to be tapped, and food distributed
to the famine-stricken people, the exterior of these
buildings was left entire, and the operation of taking
out the grain carried on by means of long shafts
bored in the adjacent ground to a depth reaching the
foundation of the Pyramid, where there were openings
from which the contents could be tapped. These
could be opened and shut at pleasure, as Joseph
ordered that all the granaries should be closed with
the exception of one, where he hoped to see his
brothers when they came to buy corn in Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Howard Vyse gives a description of one of
these entrances, thus:—“The Pyramid of Saccara.
This Pyramid was built in steps, or degrees, and was
entered from a sort of well, or shaft, made in the
sand on the northern side. The passage, which was
long and winding, and apparently in many places
forced, led to a lofty chamber, in the roof of which
wood had been employed. Various forced passages
wound around this chamber, and conducted to openings,
or windows, which looked down into it from a
considerable height.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c007'><sup>[26]</sup></a> These passages were much
encumbered with rubbish, pieces of alabaster, and
decayed wood; and in one place there was an accumulation
of large blocks of polished granite, raised
up by small fragments of stone sufficiently high to
admit of a man’s crawling beneath them. For what
purpose they were so placed we did not find out.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER V.</span><br /> <br />THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In the Talmud it is recorded that after Joseph’s
marriage with Asenath, daughter of Potipherah
the priest of On, “he built for himself a palace,
elegant and complete in its details and surroundings,
so elaborate that three years’ time was required for
its completion.” A man so wise and so powerful as
to be looked upon by the Egyptians as their king was
certainly able to make a suitable provision for the
anticipated advent of his beloved father, as well as for
all his brothers, who came with their entire households,
and possessions in flocks and herds, &amp;c., for
the famine was over the whole earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The large palace called the Labyrinth by Herodotus,
would correspond with such a provision for their
accommodation and comfort. Herodotus saw this
palace himself in the year 448 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and he describes
it thus:—“The Egyptians having become free, after
the reign of the priest of Vulcan, for they were at
no time able to live without a king, established
twelve kings, having divided all Egypt into twelve
parts. These having contracted intermarriages,
reigned, adopting the following regulations: that
they would not attempt the subversion of one another,
nor one seek to acquire more than another, and that
they should maintain the strictest friendship. They
made these regulations and strictly upheld them, for
the following reason: it had been foretold them by
an oracle, when they first assumed the government,
‘that whoever among them should offer a libation in
the temple of Vulcan from a brazen bowl should be
king of all Egypt,’ for they used to assemble in all
the temples. Now, they determined to leave in common
a memorial of themselves; and having so determined,
they built a Labyrinth, a little above the lake of
Mœris, situated near that called the city of crocodiles.
This I have myself seen, and found it greater than
can be described. For if anyone should reckon up
the buildings and public works of the Grecians, they
would be found to have cost less labour and expense
than this Labyrinth; though the temple in Ephesus
is deserving of mention, and also that in Samos.
The Pyramids likewise were beyond description,
and each of them comparable to many of the great
Grecian structures. Yet the Labyrinth surpasses
even the Pyramids. For it has <em>twelve</em> courts enclosed
with walls, with doors opposite each other, six facing
the north, and six the south, contiguous to one
another; and the same exterior wall encloses them.
It contains two kinds of rooms, some under ground
and some above ground over them, to the number of
three thousand, fifteen hundred of each. The rooms
above ground I myself went through and saw, and
relate from personal inspection. But the underground
rooms I only know from report, for the
Egyptians who have charge of the building would on
no account show me them, saying that there were the
sepulchres of the kings who originally built this
Labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles. I can
therefore only relate what I have learned by hearsay
concerning the lower rooms; but the upper ones,
which surpass all human works, I myself saw; for the
passages through the corridors, and the windings
through the courts, from their great variety, presented
a thousand occasions of wonder as I passed
from a court to the rooms, and from the rooms to
halls, and to other corridors from the halls, and to
other courts from the rooms. The roofs of all these
are of stone, as also are the walls; but the walls are
full of sculptured figures. Each court is surrounded
with a colonnade of white stone, closely fitted. And
adjoining the extremity of the Labyrinth is a Pyramid
forty orgyæ in height,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c007'><sup>[27]</sup></a> on which large figures
are carved, and a way to it has been made under
ground.”<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c007'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This curious record of these twelve kings can be
easily explained by referring to the book of Genesis,
chapter xlvii. This chapter corroborates it, for the
Israelites, the twelve sons of Jacob, had absolute
power given them by Pharaoh, and had the whole
land of Egypt under their control; for “Pharaoh
spake unto Joseph, saying, ‘Thy father and thy
brethren are come unto thee. The land of Egypt is
before thee; in the best of the land make thy father
and brethren dwell: in the land of Goshen let them
dwell; and if thou knowest any men of activity among
them, then make them rulers over my cattle.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>Owing to the severity of the famine every Egyptian
had to part with his cattle, and “Joseph gave
them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks,
and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses:
and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for
that year.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But as the famine still continued, the poor Egyptians,
when they had exchanged all they possessed
for bread, sold even their own persons. When the
whole country was in this desperate condition, the
Hebrews governed the nation for Pharaoh, who
placed implicit faith in their wisdom and probity.
These were the men styled by Egyptologists “Shepherd
Kings,” and this period or epoch is mentioned
by Manetho, the Egyptian historian, in the record
written in the Greek language, of which he was a
master; it is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“There was a king of ours, whose name was
Timaus.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c007'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Under him it came to pass, I know not
how, that God was averse to us, and there came,
after a surprising manner, men of ignoble birth out
of the eastern parts, and had boldness enough to
make an expedition into our country, and with ease
subdued it by force, yet without our hazarding a
battle with them.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c007'><sup>[30]</sup></a> So when they had gotten those
that governed us under their power, they afterwards
burnt down our cities and demolished the temples of
the gods, and used all the inhabitants after a most
barbarous manner; nay, some they slew, and led
their children and their wives into slavery.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c007'><sup>[31]</sup></a> At
length they made one of themselves king, whose
name was Salatis.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c007'><sup>[32]</sup></a> He also lived at Memphis, and
made both the upper and lower regions pay tribute,
and left garrisons in places that were most proper
for them.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c007'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“He chiefly aimed to secure the eastern part, as
foreseeing that the Assyrians, who had then the
greatest power, would be desirous of that kingdom
and invade them; and as he found in the Saite
Nomos (Seth-roite) a city very proper for his purpose,
and which lay upon the Bubastic Channel, but,
with regard to a certain theologic notion, was called
Avaris, this he rebuilt, and made very strong by the
walls he built about it, and by a most numerous
garrison of 240,000 armed men whom he put into it
to keep it. Thither Salatis came in summer-time,
partly <em>to gather his corn</em> and pay his soldiers their
wages, and partly to exercise his armed men, and
thereby to terrify foreigners.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When this man had reigned thirteen years,
after him reigned another, whose name was Beon,
for forty-four years; after him reigned another,
called Apachnas, thirty-six years and seven months;
after him Apophis reigned sixteen years; and then
Jonias, fifty years and one month; after all these,
Assis,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c007'><sup>[34]</sup></a> forty-nine years and two months. And these
six were the first rulers among them, who were all
along making war with the Egyptians, and were
very desirous gradually to destroy them to the very
roots. This whole nation was styled Hycsos, that
is, Shepherd Kings; for the first syllable <i>Hyc</i>,
according to the sacred dialect, denotes a king, as
is <i>sos</i> a shepherd, but this according to the ordinary
dialect, and of these is compounded Hycsos; but
some say that these people were Arabians. It is
also said that this word does not denote kings, but,
on the contrary, denotes captive shepherds, and this
on account of the particle <i>Hyc</i>; for that <i>Hyc</i>, with the
aspiration, in the Egyptian tongue again denotes shepherds,
and expressly also; and this seems the more
probable opinion and more agreeable to ancient history.</p>

<p class='c006'>“These people, whom we have before named
kings, and called shepherds also, and their descendants,
kept possession of Egypt 511 years.
After these, the kings of Thebais and of the other
parts of Egypt made an insurrection against the
shepherds, and that then a terrible and long war
was made between them. That under a king whose
name was Alisphragmuthosis,<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c007'><sup>[35]</sup></a> the shepherds were
subdued by him, and were, indeed, driven out of
other parts of Egypt, but were shut up in a place
that contained 10,000 acres; this place was named
Avaris. The shepherds built a wall round all this
place, which was a large and strong wall, and this
in order to keep all their possessions and their prey
within a place of strength, but that Thummosis,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c007'><sup>[36]</sup></a> the
son of Alisphragmuthosis made an attempt to take
them by force and by siege with 480,000 men to
lie round about them; but that, upon his despair of
taking the place by that siege, they came to a composition
with them, that they should leave Egypt,
and go without any harm to be done to them,
whithersoever they would; and that, after this
composition was made, they went away with their
whole families and effects, not fewer in number than
240,000, and took their journey from Egypt, through
the wilderness, for Syria;<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c007'><sup>[37]</sup></a> but that, as they were
in fear of the Assyrians, who had then dominion
over Asia, they built a city in that country which is
now called Judea, and that large enough to contain
this great number of men, and called it Jerusalem.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c007'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Manetho is altogether in a mist, for he seems
unwilling to state the truth, and still he is compelled,
as a historian, to write something, though
against his will. His malice against the Hebrews is
manifest throughout. To give an account of the
overthrow of the Egyptians at the Red Sea, he
invents this story:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“After those that were sent to work in the
quarries had continued in that miserable state for
a long while, the King was desired that he would
set apart the city Avaris,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c007'><sup>[39]</sup></a> which was then left
desolate of the shepherds, for their habitation and
protection, which desire he granted them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now this city, according to the ancient theology,
was Trypho’s city. But when the men were gotten
into it, and found the place fit for a revolt, they
appointed themselves a ruler out of the priests of
Heliopolis, whose name was Osarsiph, and they took
their oaths that they would be obedient to him in
all things. He then, in the first place, made this
law for them: that they should neither worship the
Egyptian gods, nor should abstain from any one of
those sacred animals which they have in the highest
esteem, but kill and destroy them all; that they
should join themselves to nobody but to those that
were of this confederacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When he had made such laws as these, and
many more such as were mainly opposite to the
customs of the Egyptians, he gave order that they
should use the multitude of the hands they had in
building walls about their city,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c007'><sup>[40]</sup></a> and make themselves
ready for a war with King Amenophis<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c007'><sup>[41]</sup></a>, while
he did himself take into his friendship the other
priests, and those that were polluted with them, and
sent ambassadors to those shepherds who had been
driven out of the land by Tethmosis to the city called
Jerusalem, whereby he informed them of his own
affairs, and of the state of those others that had
been treated after such an ignominious manner, and
desired that they would come with one consent to his
assistance in this war against Egypt. He also promised
that he would, in the first place, bring them
back to their ancient city and country Avaris, and
provide a plentiful maintenance for their multitude;
that he would protect them and fight for them as
occasion should require, and would easily reduce the
country under their dominion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“These shepherds were all very glad of this message,
and came away with alacrity altogether, being
in number 200,000 men, and in a little time they
came to Avaris. And now Amenophis, the King of
Egypt, upon his being informed of their invasion,
was in great confusion, as calling to mind what
Amenophis, the son of Papis, had foretold him; and,
in the first place, he assembled the multitude of the
Egyptians, and took counsel with their leaders, and
sent for their sacred animals to him, especially for
those that were principally worshipped in their
temples, and gave a particular charge to the priests
distinctly, that they should hide the images of their
gods with the utmost care.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He also sent his son Sethos, who was also
named Ramesses from his father Rhampses, being
but five years old, to a friend of his. He then
passed on with the rest of the Egyptians, being
300,000 of the most warlike of them, against the
enemy, who met them. Yet did he not join battle
with them; but, thinking that would be to fight
against the gods, he returned back and came to
Memphis, where he took Apis and the other sacred
animals which he had sent for to him, and presently
marched into Ethiopia, together with his whole
army and multitude of Egyptians;<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c007'><sup>[42]</sup></a> for the King
of Ethiopia was under an obligation to him, on
which account he received him, and took care of
all the multitude that was with him, while the
country supplied all that was necessary for the food
of the men.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He also allotted cities and villages for this exile,
that was to be from its beginning during those
fatally-determined thirteen years. Moreover, he
pitched a camp for his Ethiopian army, as a guard
to King Amenophis, upon the borders of Egypt.
And this was the state of things in Ethiopia. But
for the people of Jerusalem, when they came down
together with the polluted Egyptians, they treated
the men in such a barbarous manner, that those who
saw how they subdued the fore-mentioned country,
and the horrid wickedness they were guilty of,
thought it a most dreadful thing, for they did not
only set the cities and villages on fire, but were
not satisfied till they had been guilty of sacrilege,
and destroyed the images of the gods, and used
them in roasting those sacred animals that used to be
worshipped, and forced the priests and prophets to
be the executioners and murderers of those animals,
and then ejected them naked out of the country.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was also reported that the priest who ordained
their polity and their laws was by birth of Heliopolis,
and his name Osarsiph, from Osiris, who was
the god of Heliopolis; but that when he was gone
over to these people his name was changed, and he
was called Moses.”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c007'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>At this period the land of Egypt was in a most
desolate condition. The hand of God was upon it,
for evil plagues were sent, and nothing that did harm
to the land and its people was withheld during the
time that Moses and Aaron were negotiating with
the King to let the Hebrews go a short journey into
the wilderness to hold a festival to the Lord. Pharaoh
refusing them leave to do so, the last and direst
plague was sent, the death of the first-born in the
land of Egypt, “from the first-born of Pharaoh that
sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive
that was in the dungeon, and all the first-born of
cattle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then “Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all
his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was
a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house
wherein there was not one dead.” In his hour of
affliction the King desired these Hebrews to depart,
with everything they possessed. When the permission
was obtained, the Israelites borrowed from
the Egyptians jewels of gold and jewels of silver,
and raiment, and the Egyptians lent unto them such
things as they required. And they spoiled the
Egyptians. After this they took their departure
towards the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pharaoh, when he recovered from his paroxysm
of grief, wished to revoke the permission and get the
Hebrews back to work for him again. So he called
his people together, and, making ready his chariot,
he took them with him. “And he took six hundred
chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and
captains over every one of them, and he pursued
after the children of Israel; and the children of
Israel went out with an high hand.” And Pharaoh
with all his forces “overtook them encamping by the
sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now at this place there was no retreat for the
Israelites by land. They were compelled to effect
their escape from their pursuers by crossing the sea
to the opposite shore. Seeing the dangerous position
they were in, Moses, the man gifted with supernatural
resources, contrived to make a passage
through the sea, and, a strong east wind assisting
him throughout the night, he accomplished the construction
of a road for himself and his followers,
which should also serve as a trap to engulph their
enemies after they had effected their own escape.</p>

<p class='c006'>He, the builder of the monuments now extant in
Ethiopia and Upper Egypt, and in other parts of the
habitable earth (of which mention will be made in
the course of this narrative)—he it was who contrived
and made this passage during the night, while
the Egyptians rested after their weary march. It
was the sublimest effort of mechanical skill!</p>

<p class='c006'>When day dawned the passage was ready, and
Moses stood by and saw all his people walk down
from the Egyptian shore into the dry road in the
sea prepared for them. The waters were divided;
“and the waters were a wall unto them on their right
hand and on their left. And the Egyptians pursued
and went in after them to the midst of the sea,
even all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When the Israelites gained the Arabian shore, and
the Egyptians were in the middle between the two
shores, Moses threw back the waters that were driven
aside, and the waters returned and covered all the
host of Pharaoh that came into the sea; there escaped
not so much as one of them! And the Israelites saw
the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore; “and the
people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and
His servant Moses.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At this crisis there were only women and children
left in Egypt, and these in the deepest grief for the
death of their first-born sons. No one came back
from the camp to relate the terrible catastrophe to
these unfortunate widows and orphans; and there
was neither priest nor grown-up man to record the
events of this period in the sacred books of the
nation. Consequently, when Manetho compiled his
history from the sacred records, he was unable to
relate the events of this period clearly and without
contradiction.</p>

<p class='c006'>He accounts for the non-appearance of the King
Amenophis and his forces in Egypt, after his pursuit
of the Hebrews, by saying that he retired into Ethiopia,
and remained there thirteen years as the guest of
the king and people of Ethiopia. The son of this
Pharaoh, whom Manetho calls Sethos, was at this
time, when his father was drowned, five years old;
so that at the end of these thirteen years he attained
his majority, and the children that were his contemporaries
were old enough to help themselves. These
thirteen years form a gap in the history of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the departure of the Israelites, Egypt became
a complete wilderness, and the Egyptians were
so crushed and desolate that they seemed to have
become almost extinct. They mourned and grieved
so long that they appear to have quite forgotten
even the names of their kings and the history of their
nation. No wonder the Nile was termed the Lethe
by classic writers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The present Egyptians, the real descendants of
Mizraim, are the Copts and the Fellaheen,—poor
wretched specimens of humanity—and if these represent
their ancestors, it conclusively proves to every
traveller, when he stands in mute admiration on the
stupendous monuments of past grandeur, that they
never were the founders of such works of art and
magnificence; they never were the players on the
harp and other musical instruments depicted on the
walls of palaces, nor the refined occupants of those
noble apartments, representing the highest culture
and intelligence—apartments furnished with chairs,
sofas, and tables, and embellished with pictures of
battles and banquets, marriage-processions, funerals,
and other subjects of the greatest interest. The real
Egyptians were not the founders or builders of any
of those monumental remains which make Egypt
the land of wonders and the favourite resort of the
learned.</p>

<p class='c006'>The descendants of Abraham the Hebrew were
the guiding intellects that ruled Egypt for her
Pharaohs, who possessed discernment enough to
appoint them to rule their kingdom on account of
their wisdom and activity.</p>

<p class='c006'>About the year 1900 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Abraham went down to
Egypt from Canaan because of the famine. And
when he had seen and spoken to Pharaoh, that
monarch “gave him leave to enter into conversation
with the most learned among the Egyptians, from
which conversation his virtue and his reputation
became more conspicuous than they had been before.
For whereas the Egyptians were formerly addicted
to different customs, and despised one another’s
sacred and accustomed rites, and were very angry
one with another on that account, Abram conferred
with each of them, and, confuting the reasonings they
made use of every one for their own practices,
demonstrated that such reasonings were vain and
void of truth; whereupon he was admired by them
in those conferences as a very wise man, and one of
great sagacity, when he discoursed on any subject he
undertook; and this not only in understanding it,
but in persuading other men also to assent to him.
He communicated to them arithmetic, and delivered
to them the science of astronomy; for, before Abram
came into Egypt, they were unacquainted with those
parts of learning, for that science came from the
Chaldeans into Egypt, and from thence into Greece
and elsewhere.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c007'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This visit has been mentioned by the Greek and
Roman writers, who state these visitors to be
Shepherd Kings, the Hycsos. Abraham was immensely
wealthy, for the Bible says that “Abram
went up out of Egypt, he and his wife Sarai, and all
that he had, and Lot, his nephew, with him, into
the south. And Abram was very rich in cattle, in
silver, and in gold.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The ruins that are now existing in the Vostani, or
Middle Egypt—comprising the provinces of Fayoum,
Beni-Souef, and Minieh—and in the Bahari, or Lower
Egypt—comprising the provinces of Bahireh, Rosetta,
Damietta, Gharbiyeh, Menouf, Mansoura, and
Sharkeyeh—were the constructions and erections
of Joseph, otherwise called Zaphnath-paaneah, and
his eleven brothers; while those found in the Saïd, or
Upper Egypt—comprising the provinces of Thebes,
Djergeh, and Siout—as well as those in Nubia and
Ethiopia, sometimes called Abyssinia, owe their
erection to Moses, the descendant of Levi, one of
the brothers of Joseph.</p>

<p class='c006'>Being the adopted son of Princess Thurmuthis,
daughter of Pharaoh, Moses ruled Egypt as his
ancestors had done before his time. His return after
the siege and re-conquest of Meroë, and the entrance
in state of his bride, the Princes Tharbis, daughter of
the King of Ethiopia, are commemorated on the walls
of the palace in Upper Egypt. He became very
hateful to the Egyptians on account of his great acts
and the power he displayed, so that they conspired
against him.</p>

<p class='c006'>To save his life Moses left Egypt, and meeting
Kikanus, the King of Ethiopia, returning home from
an incursion into Assyria, Moses went with him and
his army. After a residence of nine years with the
King, the Ethiopians elected Moses to the throne of
Ethiopia on the death of Kikanus. This event took
place in the hundred and fifty-seventh year after
Israel went down into Egypt.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c007'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On the son of the King coming of age, Moses
abdicated and left Ethiopia. The Ethiopians made
him many rich presents, and sent him away with
great honours.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Abyssinia there is a colony of people quite
distinct from the Ethiopians. They differ totally
from them in personal appearance, being fair and
handsome, and decidedly of the Jewish type. In
religion and customs and language they resemble
the Jews; the characters of their writing are similar
to the Hebrew. This people must have entered
Ethiopia with Moses, and stayed behind when he
went away and entered Midian. The place they
occupy is called Amhara, situate on a hill, and their
language Amharic.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER VI.</span><br /> <br />THE SPHINX—THE ENTRANCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Great Sphinx that is on the Mokattam Hill,
facing the large Pyramids of Jeezeh, is the link of
union between the north and south of Egypt, as well
as the union of the works of those great men living
at different periods of time as rulers of Egypt—Joseph
and Moses. The following account of this
Sphinx is taken from a work called <cite>View of
Ancient and Modern Egypt</cite>, by the Rev. Michael
Russell, LL.D.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our account of the mechanical productions of
ancient Egypt would be incomplete did we not
mention the Great Sphinx, which has always been
regarded as an accompaniment, and sometimes even
as a rival, to the Pyramids. The latest information
in regard to this stupendous figure was obtained
through the persevering labours of Mr. Caviglia,
whose name has been already mentioned with so
much honour.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After the most fatiguing and anxious endeavours
during several months, he succeeded in laying open
the whole statue to its base, and exposing a clear
area extending to a hundred feet from its front. ‘It
is not easy,’ says Mr. Salt, who witnessed the process
of excavation, ‘for any person unused to operations
of this kind to form the smallest idea of the difficulties
which he had to surmount, more especially
when working at the bottom of the trench; for, in
spite of every precaution, the slightest breath of
wind, or concussion, set all the surrounding particles
of sand in motion, so that the sloping sides began to
crumble away, and mass after mass to come tumbling
down, till the whole surface bore no unapt resemblance
to a cascade of water. Even when the sides
appeared most firm, if the labourers suspended their
work but for an hour, they found on their return
that they had the greatest part of it to do over again.
This was particularly the case on the southern side
of the paw, where the whole of the people—from
sixty to a hundred—were employed for seven days
without making any sensible advance, the sand rolling
down in one continued torrent. But the discovery
amply rewarded the toil and expense which were
incurred in revealing the structure of this wonderful
work of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘The huge legs stretched out fifty feet in advance
from the body, which is in a cumbent posture; fragments
of an enormous beard were found resting
beneath the chin; and there were seen all the
appendages of a temple, granite tablet, and altar,
arranged on a regular platform immediately in front.
On this pavement, and at an equal distance between
the paws of the figure, was the large slab of granite
just mentioned, being not less than fourteen feet high,
seven broad, and two thick. The face of this stone,
which fronted the east, was highly embellished with
sculptures in bas-relief, the subject representing two
sphinxes seated on pedestals, and priests holding out
offerings, while there was an inscription in hieroglyphics
most beautifully executed; the whole design
being covered at top, and protected, as it were, with
the sacred globe, the serpent, and the wings.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Two other tablets of calcareous stone, similarly
ornamented, were supposed, together with that of
granite, to have constituted part of a miniature
temple, by being placed one on each side of the
latter, and at right angles to it. One of them, in
fact, was still remaining in its place; of the other,
which was thrown down and broken, the fragments
are now in the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘A small lion, couching in front of this edifice,
had its eyes directed towards the main figure. There
were besides several fragments of other lions rudely
carved, and the fore-part of a sphinx of tolerable
workmanship; all of which, as well as the tablets,
walls, and platforms on which the little temple stood,
were ornamented with red paint, a colour which
seems to have been, in Egypt as well as in <em>India</em>,
appropriated to sacred purposes. In front of the
temple was a granite altar, with one of the four
projections or horns still retaining its place at the
angle. From the effects of fire evident on the stone,
it is manifest that it had been used for burnt-offerings.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘On the side of the left paw of the Great Sphinx
were cut several indistinct legends in Greek characters,
addressed to different deities.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c007'><sup>[46]</sup></a> On the
second digit of the same was sculptured, in pretty
deep letters, an inscription in verse, of which the
subjoined translation was given by the late Dr.
Young, whose extensive knowledge of antiquities
enabled him at once to restore the defects of the
original, and to convey its meaning in Latin as well
as in English.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Thy form stupendous here the gods have placed,</div>

the dominion of the desert as it was half a century
ago; and, consequently, it now meets the eye of the
Egyptian traveller shrouded in sand to the same
depth as before.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dr. Richardson relates that the wind and the
Arabs had replaced the covering on this venerable
piece of antiquity, and hence the lower parts were
quite invisible. The breast, shoulders, and neck,
which are those of a human being, remain uncovered,
as also the back, which is that of a lion; the neck is
very much eroded, and, to a person near, the head
seems as if it were too heavy for its support. The
head-dress has the appearance of an old-fashioned
wig, projecting out about the ears like the hair of
the Berberi Arabs;<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c007'><sup>[47]</sup></a> the ears project considerably,
the nose is broken, the whole face has been painted
red, which is the colour assigned to the ancient
inhabitants of Egypt, and to all the deities of the
country except Osiris. The features are Nubian, or
what, from ancient representations, may be called
ancient Egyptian, which is quite different from the
negro feature. The expression is particularly placid
and benign; so much so, that the worshipper of the
Sphinx might hold up his god as superior to all the
other gods of wood and stone which the blinded
nations worshipped.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pococke found the head and neck—all that were
above ground—to be twenty-seven feet high; the
breast was thirty-three feet wide; and the entire
length about a hundred and thirty. Pliny estimated
it at a hundred and thirteen feet long and sixty-three
in height. According to Dr. Richardson, the
stretch of the back is about a hundred and twenty
feet, and the elevation of the head above the sand
from thirty to thirty-five, a result which accords
pretty nearly with the measurement of Coutelle. It
is obvious, at the same time, that the discrepancy in
these reports as to the elevation of the figure must
be attributed to the varying depth of the sand, which
appears to have accumulated greatly since the days of
the Roman naturalist.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no opening found in the body of the
statue, whereby to ascertain whether it is hollow or
not; but we learn from Dr. Pococke that there is an
entrance both in the back and in the top of the head,
the latter of which, he thinks, might serve for the
arts of the priests in uttering oracles, while the
former might be meant for descending to the apartments
beneath.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Howard-Vyse made ineffectual attempts
to pierce the Sphinx; the result, in the back of the
statue, he gives in these words:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The boring-rods were broken, owing to the carelessness
of the Arabs, at the depth of twenty-seven
feet in the back of the Sphinx. Various attempts
were made to get them out, and on the 21st of July<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c007'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
gunpowder was used for that purpose; but, being
unwilling to disfigure this venerable monument, the
excavation was given up, and several feet of boring-rods
were left in it. During the operation a very
beautiful fossil of a reed was discovered, which is
now in the British Museum.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Respecting the attempt near the shoulder, he
says:—“The operations carried on at the Sphinx
were suspended, and the hole made near the shoulder,
about twenty-five and a half feet in depth, was
plugged up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Moses who had the Sphinx cut out of the
solid rock on which it stands. The features and
the head-dress of the statue represent in colossal
proportions the features and the head-dress of his
beloved Ethiopian bride, who was “black but
comely.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The statue served as the royal entrance into the
Great Pyramid, near which it is constructed. That
this Pyramid has been entered from this direction is
evident from the fact that a ramp-stone has been
taken away from its place by some person who
approached it by a subterranean passage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The original builders,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c007'><sup>[49]</sup></a> then, were not those
who knocked out from within on the well side that
now lost ramp-stone, and exposed the inlet to the
well-mouth as it is presently seen, near the north-west
corner of the Grand Gallery. Neither was Al
Mamoun the party, for no one could have done it
except by entering the well from the very bottommost
depths of the subterranean region; and he,
the son of Caliph Haroun Al Raschid, and all his
crew, did not descend further down the entrance-passage
than merely to the level of his own forced
hole, which is not subterranean at all. Nor is the
credit claimed for any of his Arab successors, who
rather alluded to the well as an already existing
feature in their earliest time, and one they did not
understand; in large part, too, because they had
only seen, and only knew of, the upper end of it in
the north-west corner of the Grand Gallery floor;
and there it was simply a deep hole, the beginning
of darkness and the shadow of death.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who, then, did burst out that now missing ramp-stone?
Who, indeed! For the whole band of
Egyptological writers we have mentioned appear to
be convinced that ages before Caliph Al Mamoun
made his way by blundering and smashing,—long
ages, too, before Mohammed was born, and rather at
and about the period of Judah being carried captive
to Babylon,—the Egyptians themselves had entered
the Great Pyramid by cunning art and tolerable
understanding of its mere methods of construction,
and had closed it again when they left.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Yes; this Sphinx was the grand royal entrance by
which Moses and his consort entered into the interior
of the Great Pyramid. He, being inspired by Heaven,
had foreseen that in future ages the knowledge of
this entrance would be forgotten; he therefore removed
the ramp-stone and left the space it occupied
open, so as to excite the curiosity of those who might
visit the spot.</p>

<p class='c006'>He also left the world a specimen of this entrance
in a wooden statue, built far away, that this wooden
construction might serve to unriddle the passage in
the Sphinx, which leads into the Great Pyramid.
The openings in the head and back of the Sphinx
were to give light and air to the passage. The
following is a description of the wooden statue, taken
from Captain Meares’ voyages:—<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c007'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“After the English had been for some time in
King George’s Sound, the Americans began to make
use of sails of mats, in imitation of my ship. Not
long after this the English were waited upon by
Wicananish, a prince of greater wealth and power
than any they had yet seen, who invited them to
visit his kingdom, which lay at some distance to the
southward, that a commercial intercourse might be
established for the advantage of both parties.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The invitation was accepted, and Wicananish
himself met the ‘Felice’ at some distance from the
shore with a small fleet of canoes, and, coming on
board, piloted them into the harbour. They found
the capital to be at least three times the size of
Nootka. The country round was covered with
impenetrable woods of great extent, in which were
trees of enormous size.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After the King and his chiefs had been entertained
on board, the English were in return invited
to a feast by Wicananish; and it is not easy to conceive
a more interesting picture of savage life than
witnessed on this occasion. On entering the house,
we were absolutely astonished at the vast area it
enclosed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It contained a large square, boarded up close on
all sides to the height of twenty feet with planks of
an uncommon breadth and length. Three enormous
trees, rudely carved and painted, formed the rafters,
which were supported at the ends and in the middle
by gigantic images, carved out of huge blocks of
timber. The same kind of broad planks covered the
whole to keep out the rain; but they were so placed
as to be removable at pleasure, either to receive the
air and light or to let out the smoke. In the
middle of this spacious room were several fires, and
beside them large wooden vessels filled with fish
soup. Large slices of whale’s flesh lay in a state of
preparation, to be put into similar machines filled
with water, into which the women, with a kind of
tongs, conveyed hot stones from very fierce fires, in
order to make it boil.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Heaps of fish were strewed about; and in this
central part of the square, which might properly be
called the kitchen, stood large seal-skins filled with
oil, from whence the guests were served with that
delicious beverage. The trees that supported the
roof were of a size which would render the mast of
a first-rate man-of-war diminutive on a comparison
with them; indeed, our curiosity as well as our
astonishment was at its utmost stretch when we
considered the strength which must have been
required to raise these enormous beams to their
present elevation, and how such strength could be
commanded by a people wholly unacquainted, as we
supposed, with the mechanic powers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The door by which we entered this extraordinary
fabric was the mouth of one of these images, which,
large as it may, from this circumstance, be supposed
to have been, was not disproportioned to the other
features of its colossal visage. We ascended by a
few steps on the outside; and, after passing the
portal, descended down the chin into the house,
where we found new matter for wonder in the
number of men, women, and children who composed
the family of the chief, which consisted of at least
800 persons. These were divided into groups according
to their respective offices, which had distinct
places assigned them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The whole of the interior of the building was
surrounded by a bench, about two feet from the
ground, on which the various inhabitants sat, ate, and
slept. The chief appeared at the upper end of the
room, surrounded by natives of rank, on a small
raised platform, round which were placed several
large chests, over which hung bladders of oil, large
slices of whale’s flesh, and proportionable gobbets
of blubber.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Festoons of human skulls, arranged with some
attention to uniformity, were disposed in almost
every part where they could be placed, and, however
ghastly such ornaments appeared to European eyes,
they were evidently considered by the courtiers and
people of Wicananish as a very splendid and appropriate
decoration of the royal apartment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When the English appeared, the guests had
made a considerable advance in their banquet.
Before each person was placed a large slice of
boiled whale, which, with small wooden dishes filled
with oil and fish-soup, and a mussel-shell instead of
a spoon, composed the economy of the table. The
servants busily replenished the dishes as they were
emptied, and the women picked and opened some
bark, which served the purpose of towels. The
guests despatched their messes with astonishing
rapidity and voracity, and even the children, some
of them not above three years old, devoured the
blubber and oil with a rapacity worthy of their
fathers. Wicananish, in the meantime, did the
honours with an air of hospitable yet dignified
courtesy, which might have graced a more cultivated
society.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Sphinx was cut or carved on Moses’ return
from Meroë, and prior to his departure for Ethiopia,
where he was elected King. He carefully closed the
mouth, which was the door of the passage, that it
should never be opened till the fulness of time
arrived. But to prevent the monument from being
broken into by strangers, he instructed the above-mentioned
savages to make the large image, with a
door in its mouth, that it might in the future serve
as a key to solve the mystery of the Sphinx in
connection with the Great Pyramid.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER VII.</span><br /> <br />MISSION OF MOSES IN THE EAST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During his reign in Ethiopia, Moses erected the
Sphinxes and other monuments, and left inscriptions
and bas-reliefs as tokens of his presence in that
country. From thence he went to Midian, where he
did not remain idle, for there are mines there which
he must have had worked. He was commissioned
by the Almighty to deliver the Israelites and bring
them out of Egypt, and, after teaching them how to
govern themselves, to lead them to the Land of
Promise. During the forty years that the Hebrews
sojourned in the desert, Moses wrote inscriptions on
the rocks—all resembling those he left in Thebes—in
order to show to future generations the route by
which he led his people.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the foot of Mount Hor there is a remarkable
place, called by the Arabs Wady Mousa, or the
Valley of Moses; and the whole of this wild region
is celebrated for its beautiful architectural remains.
Travellers of our time are told by the Arabs that
a great prince dwelt there, and they show them a
noble edifice as Pharaoh’s Castle, and another equally
beautiful as the Palace of Pharaoh’s daughter. The
following extract, taken from the account given by
an American traveller, Mr. Stephens, describes these
edifices:—<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c007'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“At the entrance of the city there was not a
creature to dispute our passage; its portals were
wide open, and we passed along the stream down
into the area, and still no man to oppose us. In
front of the great temple, the pride and beauty of
Petra, I saw a narrow opening in the rocks, exactly
corresponding with my conception of the object for
which I was seeking. A full stream of water was
gushing through it, and filling up the whole mouth
of the passage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mounted on the shoulders of one of my Bedouins,
I got him to carry me through the swollen stream at
the mouth of the opening, and set me down on a dry
place a little above, whence I began to pick my way,
occasionally taking to the shoulders of my follower,
and continued to advance more than a mile. I was
beyond all peradventure in the great entrance I
was seeking. There could not be two such, and I
should have gone on to the extreme end of the
ravine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For about two miles it lies between high and
precipitous ranges of rocks, from five hundred to a
thousand feet in height, standing as if torn by some
great convulsion, and barely wide enough for two
horsemen to pass abreast. At the end was a large
open space, with a powerful body of light thrown
down upon it, and exhibiting in one full view the
facade of a beautiful temple, hewn out of the rock,
with rows of Corinthian columns and ornaments,
standing out fresh and clear as if but yesterday from
the hands of the sculptor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Though coming directly from the banks of the
Nile, where the preservation of the temples excites
the admiration and astonishment of every traveller,
we were roused and excited by the extraordinary
beauty and excellent condition of the great temple
at Petra (Wady Mousa). The whole temple, its
columns, ornaments, porticoes, and porches, are cut
out from and form part of the solid rock; and this
rock, at the foot of which the temple stands like a
mere print, towers several hundred feet above, its
face cut smooth to the very summit, and the top
remaining wild and misshapen as Nature made it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The whole area before the temple is perhaps an
acre in extent, enclosed on all sides, except at the
narrow entrance, and an opening to the left of the
temple, which leads into the area of the city by a
pass through perpendicular rocks five or six hundred
feet in height.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ascending several broad steps, we entered under
a colonnade of four Corinthian columns, about thirty-five
feet high, into a large chamber of some fifty feet
square and twenty-five feet high. The outside of
the temple is richly ornamented, but the interior is
perfectly plain, there being no ornament of any kind
upon the walls or ceiling; on each of the three sides
is a small chamber; and on the back wall of the
innermost chamber I saw the names of Messrs. Leigh,
Banks, Irby, and Mangles, the four English travellers
who with so much difficulty had effected their
entrance to the city; of Messieurs Laborde and
Linant, and several others.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Leaving the temple and the open area on which
it fronts, and following the stream, we entered
another defile much broader than the first, on each
side of which were ranges of tombs, with sculptured
doors and columns; and on the left, in the bosom of
the mountain, hewn out of the solid rock, is a large
theatre, circular in form, the pillars in front fallen,
and containing thirty-three rows of seats, capable
of containing more than three thousand persons.
Above the corridor was a range of doors opening to
chambers in the rocks, the seats of the princes and
wealthiest inhabitants of Wady Mousa (Petra), and
not unlike a row of private boxes in a modern
theatre. The whole theatre is at this day in such a
state of preservation that if the tenants of the tombs
around could once more rise into life, they might
take their old places on its seats and listen to the
declamation of their favourite player.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Though I had no small experience in exploring
catacombs and tombs, these were so different from
any I had seen that I found it difficult to distinguish
the habitations of the living from the chambers of
the dead. The façades or architectural decorations
of the front were everywhere handsome; and in this
they differed materially from the tombs in Egypt.
In the latter the doors were simply an opening in the
rock, and all the grandeur and beauty of the work
within; while here the door was always imposing
in its appearance, and the interior was generally a
simple chamber, unpainted and unsculptured.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c007'><sup>[52]</sup></a> I
say that I could not distinguish the dwellings from
the tombs; but this was not invariably the case.
Some were clearly tombs, for there were pits in
which the dead had been laid, and others were as
clearly dwellings, being without a place for the
deposit of the dead. One of these last particularly
attracted my attention. It consisted of one large
chamber, having on one side, at the foot of the wall,
a stone bench about one foot high and two or three
broad, in form like the divans in the East at the
present day; at the other end were several small
apartments, hewn out of the rock, with partition-wall
left between them, like stalls in a stable, and these
had probably been the sleeping apartments of the
family.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There were no paintings or decorations of any
kind within the chamber; but the rock out of which
it was hewn, like the old stony rampart that encircled
the city, was of a peculiarity and beauty that I never
saw elsewhere, being a dark ground, with veins of
white, blue, red, purple, and sometimes scarlet and
light orange, running through it in rainbow streaks;
and within the chambers, where there had been no
exposure to the action of the elements, the freshness
and beauty of the colours in which these waving lines
were drawn gave an effect hardly inferior to that of
the paintings in the tombs of the Kings at Thebes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Farther on, in the same range—though, in consequence
of the steps of the streets being broken,
we were obliged to go down and ascend again before
we could reach it—was another temple, like the first,
cut out of the solid rock, and, like the first, too,
having for its principal ornament a large urn,
shattered and bruised by musket-balls; for the
ignorant Arab, believing that gold is concealed in
it, day after day, as he passes by, levels at it his
murderous gun, in the vain hope to break the vessel
and scatter a golden shower on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From this encampment Moses led the Hebrews to
the plains of Moab, and after taking a survey of
Canaan from the top of Mount Pisgah, that is over
against Jericho, he bade them a last farewell. He
was then a hundred and twenty years old; “his eye
was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the
children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
Moab thirty days,” and Joshua became their leader
in the place of Moses. It is also recorded, that
“there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto
Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the
signs and wonders, which the Lord sent him to do
in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his
servants, and to all his land ... and in all the
great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all
Israel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Josephus the Jewish historian gives an account of
the departure of Moses from the children of Israel
thus:—<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c007'><sup>[53]</sup></a>“Now as soon as they were come to the
mountain called Abarim (which is a very high
mountain, situate over against Jericho, and one that
affords, to such as are upon it, a prospect of the
greatest part of the excellent land of Canaan), he
dismissed the senate; and as he was going to
embrace Eleazar and Joshua, and was still discoursing
with them, a cloud stood over him on the
sudden, and he disappeared in a certain valley,
although he wrote in the Holy Books that he died,
which was done out of fear, lest they should venture
to say that, because of his extraordinary virtue, he
went to God.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Modern travellers have found remains of architecture
and sculpture, which serve as landmarks in
the royal progress towards the East. No doubt
Moses had these works executed that they might
give ample proof of his presence in all those countries
wherein the remains exist—countries far divided from
each other—and so that by them his route could
easily be followed from Ethiopia to the place where
he ended his pilgrimage on earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>From Mount Abarim he took his journey eastward,
evidently with a large caravan, consisting of his faithful
followers, and forming a formidable escort. The
first place at which they halted for any length of
time is in Persia, where there are unmistakable signs
of his sojourn. The following is an account given by
Mr. Morier, who accompanied Sir Harford Jones
Brydges on the mission to Persia in 1809:—<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c007'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“The sculptures are situated at the distance of
about fifteen miles from Kázerún. About seven miles
from it I passed the ruined village of Derses; and,
leaving two tombs, one on the right hand and the
other on the left of the road, came to the bed of a
torrent, over which there seems to have been built
an aqueduct, for, on each side of its banks, there are
remains of masonry, and traces of its conduit may
be perceived on the southern bank.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The extent of the ruins of Shahpúr to the southward
is bounded by a beautiful stream of water. Over
the spring from which it issues the road is sustained
by fragments of architecture, which are part of the
entablature of some public building, and, by their
dimensions, must have once been magnificent.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Immediately after passing the spring, we came
upon the ruins of Shahpúr. When standing on an
eminence, we computed the whole to be comprised,
on a rough calculation, within a circumference of
six miles. This circumference enclosed a tract of
plain, and a hill, on which the remains of the ancient
citadel formed a conspicuous and commanding object.
Whether by the caprice of Nature or by the labour
of man, this hill or acropolis is distinctly separated
from the great range of mountains forming the most
eastern boundary of the plain of Kázerún.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Between this and another imposing mass of rock
runs the beautiful river of Shahpúr. We reckoned
the space between the two rocks at thirty yards,
which formed a little plain of verdure and shrubbery,
intersected, indeed, by the stream of the river. The
opening between the two grand masses presented a
landscape the most varied, the most tranquil, the
most picturesque, and, at the same time, the most
sublime, that imagination can form.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A black and stupendous rock flanked the right
of the picture; while another still more extraordinary
rock, as richly illumined as the other was darkened,
supported the left. Between both a distant range of
mountains, whose rocks were terminated by a plain,
filled up the interstices, forming a fine aërial perspective;
whilst the river and rich shrubbery completed
a most enlivening foreground.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The hill on which the remains of the citadel
stand is covered by ruins of walls and turrets. On
its eastern aspect the nature of the fortification can
be traced easily; for walls fill the chasms from rock
to rock, forming altogether a place of defence admirably
strong. The first object which arrested our
attention was a mutilated sculpture of two colossal
figures on horseback, carved on the superfices of the
rock. The figure on the right was most injured;
the only part, indeed, which we could ascertain with
precision was one of the front and two of the hinder
feet of a horse, standing over the statue of a man,
who was extended at his full length, his face turning
outwardly, and reposed upon his right hand, and his
attire bearing marks of a Roman costume. A figure
in the same dress was placed in an attitude of supplication
at the horse’s knees, and a head in alto-relievo
just appeared between the hinder feet. The equestrian
figure on the left is not quite so much mutilated,
the horse and parts of the drapery on the thighs being
still well preserved.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The next piece of sculpture (which, like the
former, was carved upon the mountain of the citadel)
is perfect in all its parts. It consists of three grand
compartments; the central and most interesting
represents a figure on horseback, whose dress announces
a royal personage. His head-dress is a
crown, on which is placed a globe; his hair flows
in very large and massy curls over both shoulders,
whilst a slight mustachio just covers his upper lip,
and gives much expression to a countenance strongly
indicative of pride and majesty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“His body is clothed with a robe, which falls in
many folds to his girdle, and then extends itself over
his thigh and legs as low as his ancle. A quiver
hangs by his side; in his right hand he holds the
hand of a figure behind him, which stands so as to
cover the whole hind quarter of his horse, and which
is dressed in the Roman tunic and helmet. A figure,
habited also in the Roman costume, is on its knees
before the head of the horse, with its hands extended
and with a face betraying entreaty. Under the feet
of the horse is another figure extended, in the same
attire and character as that of the other two Roman
figures.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To the right of the tablet stands a figure with
his hands also extended, but dressed in a different
manner, and, as far as we could judge, with features
more Egyptian than European. In the angle between
the King’s head and the horse’s is a Victory displaying
the scroll of fame. A figure (part of which is
concealed by the one on its knees) completes the
whole of this division.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The second grand compartment, which is on the
right, is divided again into six sub-compartments, in
each of which are carved three figures, the costumes
and general physiognomies of which are all different.
They appear mostly in postures of supplication, and,
I should suspect, are representations of vanquished
people.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On the left, in the third grand compartment,
are rows of horsemen, divided by one line into two
smaller compartments. They have all the same
characteristic dress and features as the royal figure
in the centre, and certainly represent his forces. The
whole of this most interesting monument is sculptured
in a very hard rock, which bears the finest polish,
and which we pronounced to be a coarse species of
jasper. The figures on foot are in height five feet
nine inches: figures on horseback, from the rider’s
cap to the horse’s hoofs, six feet ten inches in length;
the grand tablet eleven feet eleven inches.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Having examined these, we next crossed the
river to the sculptures on the opposite rock. The
first is a long tablet containing a multitude of figures.
The principal person (who is certainly the King
represented in the former tablet) is placed in the very
centre of the piece, alone in a small compartment,
and is seated with a sword placed betwixt his legs,
on the pommel of which rests his left hand. On his
right, on the uppermost of two long slips, are many
men, who seem to be a mixture of Persians and
Romans, the former conducting the latter as prisoners.
Under these, in the lower step, are others,
who by their wigs appear to be Persians. Their
leader bears a human head in both hands, and extends
it towards the central figure. On the left
are four small compartments. The first (nearest
that figure, and the highest from the ground) incloses
a crowd of men, whose arms are placed over
one another’s shoulders. Below these are five
figures, one of whom leads a horse without any
more furniture than a bridle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The other two compartments are filled up with
eight figures each. We considered this to represent
in general a King seated in his room of audience,
surrounded by his own people, and by nations
tributary to him. The length is eleven yards four
inches. On the left of this were two colossal figures
on horseback carved in alto-relievo. The one to the
right had all the dress, character, and features of the
King above described; the other on the left appeared
also a royal personage, but differing in dress and in
the furniture of his horse. Both had their hands
extended, and held a ring, which we conceived to be
emblematical of peace.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After having re-passed the river, we walked over
the numerous mounds of stones and earth which
cover the ruined buildings of Shahpúr, and which,
if ever explored, would discover innumerable secrets
of antiquity. We were conducted by the peasants
who were with us to the remains of a very fine wall,
which in the symmetry of its masonry equalled any
Grecian work that I have ever seen. Each stone
was four feet long, twenty-seven inches thick, and
cut to the finest angles.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The wall formed the front of a square building,
the area of which is fifty-five feet. At the top were
placed sphinxes couchant, a circumstance which we
ascertained from discovering accidentally two eyes
and a mutilated foot, at the extremity of one of the
upper stones. In this wall there is a window, which
is arched by the formation of its upper stone. Behind
this square building we traced most correctly the
configuration of a theatre, thirty paces in length and
fourteen in breadth. The place resembled, at
least, those called theatres which I have seen in
Greece. From a comparison of their positions, we
were led to suppose that the building still extant
must have been connected with the other behind
it, and may have formed, perhaps, the entrance
to it.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c007'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These commemorative sculptures denote that
the stranger King (Moses) and his forces took
possession of Derses near Shahpúr by conquest; and
the length of time he remained in the country may
be inferred from the interregnum, or unrecorded
interval, between the Assyrian epochs of Nimrúd
and Khorsabad. The supposed duration of that
period is about sixty or seventy years, and it began
just about the time that Moses left the children of
Israel, so that it synchronises with the arrival of
Moses in the country, and his residence there fills
up the gap.</p>

<p class='c006'>The number of his followers must have increased
during the years that Moses travelled from one
country to another, and he was likely in consequence
to leave some of them to colonise, and to teach his
doctrine, and to carry on the ordinances of his
religion, in every region that was suitable for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Afghans, whose country lies nearest to Persia,
claim descent from the Jews, and the people of
Kafiristan are unmistakably Jews. These inhabit
a mountainous country adjoining Afghanistan, on
the north-west of Cashmere.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Caufirs<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c007'><sup>[56]</sup></a> have no general name for their
nation. Each tribe has its peculiar name, for they
are all divided into tribes, though not according to
genealogy, but to geographical position, each valley
being held by a separate tribe. The Mussulmans
confound them all under the name of Caufir, or
infidel, and call their country Caufiristaun. They
also call one division of them Seeaposh (black-vested),
or Tor Caufirs (black infidels), and another Speen
Caufirs (white infidels). Both epithets are taken
from their dress, for the whole of the Caufirs are
remarkable for the fairness and beauty of their complexion,
but those of the largest division wear a sort
of vest of black goat-skin, while the others dress in
white cotton.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are several languages among the Caufirs,
but they have all many words in common, and all
have a near connection with the Sanskrit. Their
religion does not resemble any other with which I
am acquainted. They believe in one God; but they
also worship numerous idols, which, they say, represent
great men of former days, who intercede with
God in favour of their worshippers. These idols
are of stone or wood, and always represent men or
women, some mounted and some on foot.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They have hereditary priests. They have also
persons who can procure an inspiration of some
superior being by holding their heads over the smoke
of a sacrifice. Their festivals are often accompanied
with a sacrifice, and always with a feast. They
have no titles of their own, but they have borrowed
that of Khaun from the Afghans for their rich
men. Their property chiefly consists in cattle and
slaves.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The houses of the Caufirs are often of wood, and
they have generally cellars where they keep their
cheeses, clarified butter, wine, and vinegar. In
every house there is a wooden bench fixed to the
wall, with a low back to it. There are also stools
shaped like drums, but smaller in the middle than at
the ends, and tables of the same sort, but larger.
The Caufirs, partly from their dress and partly from
habit, cannot sit like the other Asiatics; and if forced
to sit down on the ground, stretch out their legs like
Europeans. They have also beds made of wood and
thongs of neats’ leather: the stools are made of
wicker-work.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They celebrate a sacrifice at a particular place
near the village where there was a stone post; a
fire was kindled before it, through which flour,
butter, and water were thrown on the stone. At
length an animal was sacrificed, and the flesh was
burned, and part eaten by the assistants, who were
numerous, and who accompanied the priest in prayers
and devout gesticulations.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c007'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Their neighbours, the dwellers in the beautiful
vale of Cashmere, also claim descent from the Jews,
“a claim<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c007'><sup>[58]</sup></a> borne out by the personal appearance of
the race, their garb, the cast of their countenance,
and the form of their beards. There is a belief, too,
among them that Moses died in the capital of Cashmere,
and that he is buried near it.” (This belief is
erroneous, as that Lawgiver ended his days very far
away from Cashmere.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no doubt that they were originally of
Brahmin (Hebrew) origin; and prosperous must
have been the people—wise, beneficent, and energetic
the rulers, in those old days, if tradition and legend
are to be believed, and the mighty monuments of a
past grandeur, long anterior to the days when Mogul
wealth and taste embellished the valley, are to be
looked on as faithful witnesses; but to this golden
age succeeded centuries of oppression.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We must, therefore, not be too hard on the
Kashmiri; his faults are those that oppression
fosters, and his virtues, for he has some, are his
industry, his religious toleration, his observance of
family ties and obligations, while for qualities of head
and hand he is second to no Eastern race. As
artificers, the pale, slim, sneaking denizens of the
crowded lanes of Sreenuggur will compete with any
in the East, and the sturdy, broad-shouldered, large-limbed
peasant is a painstaking and successful
husbandman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Among the many changes of masters which
Cashmere has undergone, one class of men appear
not only to have retained the religion of their
Brahmin (Hebrew) forefathers, but also a high
position among their fellows. I allude to the
Kashmiri Pundits—men of lengthy pedigree, of
wealth and influence, who, thanks to their superior
education and fitness for business, were largely employed
by their successive conquerors, placed in posts
of trust, and seemingly exempted from the forcible
conversion to the creed of Mahommed, which was
universally imposed on their countrymen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From Cashmere the invading host of Moses entered
Hindostan, known at that period under the name of
Ind, from the river Indus. The natives of the
country were a variety of barbarous tribes, who
resisted the entry of Moses and his followers, and
many sanguinary battles were fought before they
were subdued, and the conquerors permitted to take
possession of the whole peninsula. Here Moses
assumed the name of Manu, and called his Hebrew
nationality Brahmin.</p>

<p class='c006'>The language he employed while in Hindostan was
Sanscrit; all his laws and ordinances were written in
this sacred language. He established classes or castes.
The Brahmins in India occupied the same position
as the Levites in Judea, and were the priests, the
instructors, and the philosophers of the nation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chronicles of this epoch record the wars and
the brave exploits of heroes, and the wisdom and
learning of the conquerors. The first mention made
of this invading nation gives as their residence a
tract of country between the rivers Sersooty and
Caggar, distant from Delhi about one hundred miles
to the north-west. It then bore the name of Bram-haverta,
as being the haunt of gods; and although it
was but about sixty-five miles long by forty broad,
it was the scene of the adventures of the first princes,
and the residence of the most famous sages. They
extended their territory, which seems to have included
at that time the districts of Oude, Agra, Allahabad,
Lahore, and Delhi. The city of Oude, then termed
Ayodha, was the capital. In course of time they
moved down the peninsula, and subdued the Deccan
and the whole of the south. The celebrated rock
temples of Ellora, and the sculptured cave of Elephanta,
are some of the many monuments left by
these Brahmins, the descendants of Abraham the
Hebrew. Every traveller, in viewing these wonderful
remains is forcibly reminded of similar remains
in Egypt and Nubia—unmistakable proof of the
works having been executed under the guidance of
the same inspired intellect.</p>

<p class='c006'>The colonies left by Moses or Manu in the peninsula
of India within the Ganges were distinctly
traceable in the days of Alexander the Great, the
southern colonists being swarthy, tall, and handsome,
not unlike Ethiopians, whilst those of the northern
latitudes were much fairer, and not unlike the Egyptians,
and those still farther south were Jews. Of
such as these were the forces and followers of Moses
in his progress over the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>After conquering the whole peninsula he left the
mainland and went over to the island of Ceylon. The
Cingalese are well versed in biblical history; and
they even believe that Adam and Eve came to Ceylon
after their expulsion from the garden of Eden. There
are remains of former grandeur and colossal statues
to mark the presence of the god-like Lawyer in the
island.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the island of Ceylon he went by sea and
landed on the opposite peninsula, or India beyond the
Ganges. The neighbourhood of Siam has splendid
ruins of most noble buildings and statuary. In
Bangkok, the capital of Siam, the temples and all
other religious buildings are evidently of Egyptian
origin. The Siamese of the present time, from the
King to the peasant, live in poor houses of wood or
bamboo; and they frankly admit that they did not
build those ancient monuments, and do not even
know who were the builders of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Recent travellers in Chin-India speak in rapturous
terms of the ruins of Angkor, the great temple in
Siam. One writer says: “The ruins of Angkor are
as imposing as the ruins of Thebes or Memphis, and
more mysterious”; while another thinks that “one
of these temples, a rival to that of Solomon, and
erected by some ancient Michael Angelo, might take
an honourable place beside our most beautiful buildings.
It is grander than anything left to us by
Greece or Rome.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The following description of these wonderful ruins
is taken from the work of a recent traveller who
visited them:—<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c007'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“The ruins of Angkor are situated in the province
of Siamrap, eastern Siam, in about lat. 13° 30’ N. and
long. 104° E. We entered upon an immense causeway,
the stairs of which were flanked with six huge
griffins, each carved from a single block of stone.
This causeway, which leads directly to the main
entrance of the temple, is 725 feet in length, and is
paved with stones, each of which measures four feet
in length by two in breadth. On either side of it
are artificial lakes fed by springs, and each covering
about five acres of ground. We passed through one
of the side gates and crossed the square to a <i>sala</i>
situated at the very entrance of the temple. Embosomed
in the midst of a perfect forest of cocoa,
betel-nut, and toddy palms, and with no village in
sight, excepting a dozen or more huts, the abodes of
priests having the charge of it; the general appearance
of the wonderful temple is beautiful and romantic
as well as impressive and grand. A just idea of it
can hardly be conveyed by writing; it must be seen
to be understood and appreciated. Still, perhaps, a
detailed description might assist the imagination
somewhat in forming a proper estimate of the
grand genius which planned, and the skill and
patience which executed, such a masterpiece of architecture.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The outer wall of Nagkon Wat—which words
signify a city or assemblage of temples or monasteries—about
half a mile square, is built of sandstone,
with gateways on each side, which are handsomely
carved with figures of gods and dragons, arabesques,
and intricate scrolls. Upon the western side is the
main gateway, and passing through this and up a
causeway (paved with slabs of stone three feet in
length by two in breadth) for a distance of a thousand
feet, you arrive at the central main entrance of the
temple. About the middle of the causeway, on
either side, are image-houses, much decayed and
overgrown with rank parasitic plants; and a little
farther on are two small ponds, with carved stone
copings, which in most places are thrown down.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The foundations of Nagkon Wat are as much as
ten feet in height, and are very massively built of the
same volcanic rock as that used in the construction of
the ‘Angels’ Bridge.’ The entire edifice, which is
raised on three terraces, the one about thirty feet
above the other, including the roof, is of stone, but
without cement; and so closely fitting are the joints
as even now to be scarcely discernible. The quarry
where the stone was hewn is about two days’ travel—thirty
miles—distant; and it is supposed the transportation
of the immense boulders could only have
been effected by means of a water communication—a
canal or river, or when the country was submerged
at the end of the rainy season. The shape of the
building is oblong, being 796 feet in length and 588
feet in width, whilst the highest central pagoda rises
some 250 odd feet above the ground, and four others,
at the angles of the court, are each about 150 feet in
height.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Passing between low railings, we ascend a platform
composed of boulders of stone four feet in
length, one and a half feet in width, and six inches
in thickness, and enter the temple itself through a
columned portico, the façade of which is beautifully
carved in basso-relievo with ancient mythological
subjects. From this doorway, on either side, runs a
corridor, with a double row of columns, cut—base
and capital—from single blocks, with a double, oval-shaped
roof covered with carving and consecutive
sculptures upon the outer wall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This gallery of sculptures, which forms the exterior
of the temple, consists of over half a mile of
continuous pictures, cut in basso-relievo upon sandstone
slabs six feet in width, and represents subjects
taken from Hindoo mythology—from Ramayana, the
Sanscrit epic poem of India, with its 25,000 verses
describing the exploits of the god Rama and the son
of the King of Oudh. The contests of the King of
Ceylon, and Hunaman, the monkey god, are graphically
represented. There is no key-stone used in the
arch of this corridor, and its ceiling is uncarved. On
the walls are sculptured the immense number of
100,000 separate figures (or at least heads). Entire
scenes from the Ramayana are pictured; one, I remember,
occupies 240 feet of the wall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Weeks might be spent in studying, identifying,
and classifying the varied subjects of this wonderful
gallery. You see warriors riding upon elephants and
in chariots, foot soldiers with shield and spear, boats,
unshapely divinities, trees, monkeys, tigers, griffins,
hippopotami, serpents, fishes, crocodiles, bullocks,
tortoises, soldiers of immense physical development,
with helmets, and some people with beards. The
figures stand somewhat like those on the great Egyptian
monuments, the side partly turned towards the
front; in the case of the men, one foot and leg are
always placed in advance of the other; and I noticed,
besides, five horsemen, armed with spear and sword,
riding abreast, like those seen upon the Assyrian
tablets in the British Museum. In the procession
several of the kings are preceded by musicians playing
upon shells and long bamboo flutes. Some of the
kings carry a sort of battle-axe, others a weapon
which much resembles a golf-club, and others are
represented as using the bow and arrow. In one
place is a grotesque divinity, who sits elegantly
dressed upon a throne surmounted by umbrellas;
this figure, of peculiar sanctity, evidently, has been
recently gilded, and before it, upon a small table,
there were a dozen or more ‘joss-sticks’ kept constantly
burning by the faithful.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c007'><sup>[60]</sup></a> But it is almost
useless to particularise when the subjects and style
of execution are so diverse. Each side of the long
corridor seemed to display figures of distinct feature,
dress, and character.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘The most interesting sculptures,’ says Dr. Adolf
Bastian, the President of the Royal Geographical
Society of Berlin, who explored these wonderful
ruins in 1864, ‘the most interesting sculptures at
Nagkon Wat are in two compartments, called by the
natives respectively the procession and the three
stages (heaven, earth, and hell). What gives a
peculiar interest to this section is the fact that the
artist has represented the different nationalities in all
their distinctive characteristic features, from the flat-nosed
savage in the tasseled garb of the Pnom, and
the short-haired Lao, to the straight-nosed Rajaput,
with sword and shield, and the bearded Moor, giving
a catalogue of nationalities, like another column of
Trajan in the predominant physical conformation of
each race. On the whole there is such a prevalence
of Hellenic cast in the features and profiles, as well
as in the elegant attitude of the horsemen, that one
might suppose Xenocrates of old, after finishing his
labours in Bombay, had made an excursion to the
east.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are figures sculptured in high relief (nearly
life-size) upon the lower parts of the walls about the
entrance; all are females, and apparently of Hindoo
origin. The interior of the quadrangle, bounded
by the long corridor just described, is filled with
galleries—halls, formed with huge columns, crossing
one another at right angles. In the Nagkon Wat
as many as 1,532 solid columns have been counted,
and among the entire ruins of Angkor there are
reported to be the immense number of 6,000, almost
all of them hewn from single blocks and artistically
carved. On the inner side of the corridor there are
blank windows, each of which contains seven beautifully
turned little columns. The ceilings of the
galleries were hung with tens of thousands of bats
and pigeons, and other birds had made themselves
comfortable nests in out-of-the-way corners.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We pass on up steep staircases, with steps not
more than four inches in width, to the centre of
the galleries which here bisect one another. There
are two detached buildings in this square. In one of
the galleries we saw two or three hundred images—made
of stone, wood, brass, clay—of all shapes and
sizes and ages (some of the large stone idols are said
to be 1,400 years old).</p>

<p class='c006'>“We walk on across another causeway, with small
image-houses<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c007'><sup>[61]</sup></a> on either hand, and up a steep flight
of steps, fully thirty feet in height, to other galleries
crossing each other in the centre above which rises
the grand central pagoda, 250 feet in height, and at
the four corners of the court four smaller spires.
These latter are much dilapidated and do not now
display their full height; the porticoes also bear
evidence of the presence of the ‘heavy hand of
time.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is one more gallery, and then we come to
the outer corridor, and pass through a magnificent
doorway to the rear of the temple, and walk round
to our <i>sala</i>, not knowing which to admire the most,
the vastness of the plan or the propriety and grace
of the performance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The principal ruins of Siam and Cambodia yet
discovered lie in the province of Siamrap, as already
stated. At about three miles north-east of Angkor,
on the opposite side of the Siamrap river, are the
ruins of a city called Pentaphrohm, the citadel of Taphrohm,
and near it is a <i>wat</i> styled Phrakeoh, or the
Gem Tower, presenting the same combination of a
royal and priestly residence as Angkor and Nagkon
Wat. Some of these temples and palaces, with their
columns, sculptures, and statues, are quite as interesting,
though not so well-preserved, as those at
Angkor. About four miles east of Nagkon Wat are
two other remains of antiquity, Bakong and Lailan.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the province of Battambong, forty or fifty miles
south-west from Siamrap town, there are also ruins,
temples, monasteries, and palaces, and indeed the
whole valley of the Makong river to the very borders
of China is spread with ruins of more or less magnitude,
beauty, and interest. Near the monastery of
Phrakeoh is an artificial lake called Sasong (the royal
lake), built by the kings of Pentaphrohm, and surrounded
with pleasure-houses for their recreation.
Dr. Bastian thinks that it must have been a work
of immense labour, and the whole population of Cambodia
of to-day would scarcely be able to raise such
a gigantic structure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The lake of Sasong he describes as being ‘of oblong
shape, about 2,000 feet broad and 4,000 feet long,
and surrounded by a high embankment of solid
masonry. Some of the blocks are fourteen to sixteen
feet long and highly finished. In convenient places
square platforms were built overhanging the water,
with broad flights of steps leading down to it, and in
such places the huge masses of stone laid on each
other are embellished by delicate chisellings, bearing
the figures of serpents, eagles, lions (in their fabulous
shapes as Naga, Kruth, Sinto) on the ends. In the
middle of the lake is a small island with the remains
of a former palace upon it. Of all the figures used
for ornaments, that which recurs most frequently
is that of the Naga; and the Chinese officer who
visited Cambodia in 1295 describes already ‘the
pillars of the stone bridges adorned with serpents,
each of which had nine heads.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“About half a mile north-west of Nagkon Wat there
are the ruins of an observatory, built upon the summit
of a hill perhaps 500 feet in height. A foot-path
leads up this hill through the thick jungle. The first
indication of any antiquities thereabouts is two immense
stone griffins, one standing on each side of the
path; and next we pass a small image with the head
of an elephant and the body of a human being; it is
the elephant-headed Ganesh—the god of wisdom of
the Hindoo mythology. This hill is cut in five
terraces paved with stone, and having staircases, each
about twelve feet in height, ornamented with stone
lions upon their balusters; and at the corners of each
terrace are small image-houses.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The building is quadrilateral, and covers the entire
crest of the hill, there being four entrances; the
central spire is now an unshapely mass of large
boulders, all overgrown with trees, shrubs, and vines.
From the summit we obtained an extensive view of
the surrounding country. To the north there extended
from east to west a range of low blue hills;
to the south-east we could just discern the placid
waters of Lake Thalaysap; to the south lay the quaint
old town of Siamrap, and to the south-west there was
another large lake of bright, clear water.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On his arrival in the southern portion of the
peninsula beyond the Ganges, the great Lawgiver
evidently set his followers to execute the wonderful
monuments above described.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sculptures on the walls of the palace of Angkor
represent exploits of bravery and conquest, from the
first invasion of Ind to the arrival of the invaders
on the island of Ceylon, and to their landing in
Siam.</p>

<p class='c006'>The observatory shows that Moses loved astronomy,
and pursued the study of that science in the distant
east as he had done in Thebes.</p>

<p class='c006'>When these noble undertakings were completed—which
serve as <i>souvenirs</i> of his visit to the country—he,
no doubt, left a colony to protect them, and
proceeded northward, where there are ample traces
which clearly indicate the route. The country he
came to was like that which is on the other side of
the Bay of Bengal, inhabited by various tribes of
savages.</p>

<p class='c006'>The empire he founded here was called the Empire
of Brahma, and the people Brahmins. The scriptures
were expounded, and the doctrine of the Lawgiver
propagated, so that the natives of the country to this
day relate the fall of Adam, and all the particulars
regarding that memorable event. The following is
a literal translation, by Dr. Mason, of some rude
verses which the Karens have preserved:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Anciently, God commanded, but Satan appeared bringing destruction.</div>
      <div class='line'>Formerly, God commanded, but Satan appeared deceiving unto death.</div>
      <div class='line'>The woman Eu and the man Tha-nai pleased not the eye of the dragon.</div>
      <div class='line'>The dragon looked on them, the dragon beguiled the woman and Tha-nai.</div>
      <div class='line'>How is this said to have happened?</div>
      <div class='line'>The great dragon succeeded in deceiving—deceiving unto death.</div>
      <div class='line'>How do they say it was done?</div>
      <div class='line'>A yellow fruit took the great dragon, and gave to the children of God;</div>
      <div class='line'>A white fruit took the great dragon, and gave to the daughter and son of God.</div>
      <div class='line'>They transgressed the commands of God, and God turned His face from them.</div>
      <div class='line'>They kept not all the words of God—were deceived, deceived unto sickness.</div>
      <div class='line'>They kept not all the law of God—were deceived, deceived unto death.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is evident that this tradition came from a
written source, and there is no other source than
the books of Moses.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is in the Christian world an erroneous
acceptation of the first and second chapters of the
first book of Moses. Expounders of the Pentateuch,
of our enlightened age, err with respect to
these two chapters, and the consequence of this error
is much confusion among believers. These expounders
say that God created only one man at the creation
of the world; and that when this man complained
of <i>ennui</i> and loneliness, then the Almighty created
the woman to keep him company. This account of
the creation of man has been the cause of many
controversies and divisions and secessions from the
true faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first chapter of Genesis, Moses records the
creation of heaven and earth with all the contents of
each of them. Man, male and female, was created
on the sixth day—not one couple, but many couples,
as other animals were created; they were without
number. And the Almighty blessed them, and told
them to multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue
it; to have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
moveth upon the earth. He gave them every herb
bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth,
and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree
yielding seed, for meat, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was accomplished on the sixth day; and “on
the seventh day He rested from all His work which
He had made. And God blessed the seventh day,
and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested
from all His work which God had created and made.”</p>

<p class='c006'>After this first seventh day, God created Adam,
and the Lord God formed <em>this</em> man of the dust of
the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life; and he became a living soul. “And the
Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and
there he put <em>this</em> man whom he had formed. And
out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every
tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food;
the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and
the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And a
river went out of Eden to water the garden; and
from thence it was parted, and became into four
heads.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man Adam was ruddy, for the earth or dust
out of which he was formed was red. The rest of
the men who were created on the sixth day were
black, for the garden of Eden was divided from the
rest of negroland by the river Nile, which surrounded
it entirely. During the heavy rains in this portion
of Africa, the waters of the lakes overflow, the Nile,
passing in its course through the red soil of Ethiopia,
gets tinged with that colour; and the waters, after
entering Egypt, retain that hue for a long distance
towards the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the Lord God took the man (Adam) and
put him in the garden of Eden, to dress it and to
keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man,
saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest
freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that
thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” So this
man alone, of all the created human beings, received
this commandment from God.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is sculptured on the wall of a palace in
Upper Egypt, which Norden, the Danish traveller
saw and sketched, a group of three persons with a
tree in the centre. The principal personage in this
group is seated, and is addressing a man standing
before him, as if giving the commandment above
stated. The third figure is of a man standing behind
the seated person, with a sarcastic expression of
countenance. This sculpture no doubt represents
the event in question.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this, Eve was created. And it is recorded
that “the serpent was more subtil than any beast of
the field which the Lord God had made.” He
tempted the woman, and succeeded in making her
break the commandment which God had given to
Adam.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now there is another sculpture in Upper Egypt,
representing a man with a serpent’s head. So that
the creature that tempted and seduced Eve was a
man; and he made her commit two sins: she broke
the commandment of God, and her troth to her
husband. When she had thus doubly sinned, she
beguiled her husband, and persuaded him to disobey
his Creator.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Lord God visited the garden of Eden at certain
hours of the day, and Adam and Eve attended as
keepers of it. But when the time of the visit of the
Lord God arrived, the man and his wife hid themselves,
so that the Lord called for Adam, “and said
unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard
Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I
was naked; and I hid myself. And He said, Who
told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
shouldest not eat? And the man said, The woman
whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the
tree, and I did eat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the Lord God said unto the woman, What
is this that thou hast done? And the woman said,
The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And the
Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast
done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above
every beast of the field; <em>upon thy belly shalt thou go</em>,
and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life; and
I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy
head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From this it is evident that the serpent, before he
was cursed by God, walked erect as a man, and it
was only after the curse that he became the creeping
animal that we see him now. The Almighty, in His
pity, made coats of skins for Adam and Eve, and
clothed them. This is another proof that this man
and his wife were different from the rest of mankind,
for these clothe themselves, whereas savages, to this
day, go about without clothing of any kind—perfectly
naked as in the day they were created.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moses, in thus separating these two from other
beings, gave a beginning to the Jewish nation, as
descending from the children of God. He was the
historian of this nation, and it was for these people
that he wrote his laws and ordinances of religion.
Other nations of the earth are only mentioned by
him in his records incidentally, as coming in contact
with his nation by chance or accident.</p>

<p class='c006'>The confusion made by the seventy elders who
translated the Pentateuch from the Hebrew into
Greek, by having added six verses to the second
chapter of the book of Genesis, has caused great
mischief in the Church, resulting in disbelief of the
Bible. If these first six verses were removed from
the second chapter, the version would be quite
correct, and as it was intended by Moses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden of
Eden, and, proceeding to the East along the Nile,
they made the caves in the rocks their dwelling-place.
In due time Eve gave birth to the child
conceived in sin, and she called him Cain. She had
another son after this, whom she called Abel. Cain
had the vices of the serpent, and consequently hated
this younger brother; and when they became old
enough to offer sacrifices to God, he found that while
his brother’s offering was accepted, his was rejected.
Thereupon high words were spoken, and, rising up
in anger, he struck his brother and killed him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel
thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my
brother’s keeper? And He said, What hast thou
done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto
me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from
the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive
thy brother’s blood from thy hand; when thou
tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto
thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt
thou be in the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment
is greater than I can bear. Behold, Thou hast driven
me out this day from the face of the earth; and from
Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and
a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass,
that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever
slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him
sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain,
lest any finding him should kill him. And Cain
went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we have the first mention of intercourse
between the people that were created in the world
on the sixth day, and a descendant of Adam and
Eve, who were created by the Lord God in the
second week, and placed by themselves in the
garden of Eden. This land of Nod, on the east of
Eden, where Cain took up his abode, and married a
woman of the land, must have been near Noph in
Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said Eve had another son, after the death of
Abel and the departure of Cain; he was named Seth.
In the Pentateuch the children of Adam and Eve are
called the sons of God; and the descendants of the
human family in the world at large were styled the
sons and daughters of men.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Munipúr snake-worship is still in existence.
It is reported that:—“The Raja’s peculiar god is a
species of snake called Pakúng-ba, from which the
royal family claim descent. When it appears it is
coaxed on to a cushion by the priestess in attendance,
who then performs certain ceremonies to
please it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This snake appears, they say, sometimes of great
size, and when he does so it is indicative of his
being displeased with something. But as long as he
remains of diminutive form it is a sign he is in good
humour. Pakúng-ba is a snake by day, and by
night assumes the human form. A house is prepared
for it, and when it appears the priests give intimation
of it, and all the head men and most orthodox
Hindus, from the Raja downwards, do <i>poojah</i> (worship)
before it.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c007'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The colonists left by Moses in his progress through
the different countries of Eastern Asia claim descent
from celestial beings, especially in India beyond the
Ganges, in China, and other kingdoms as far as the
western shores of America. This claim originated
from their being the direct descendants of Adam and
Eve. The savages among whom they dwelt in
bygone days admitted the claim, and, moreover,
credited them with divine attributes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The kings of Burmah consider the throne-room of
their palace, where they receive homage from their
subjects and strangers, as holy ground, and have
made it a rule that all who seek the royal presence
shall put off their shoes. Embalming the dead is
also practised in Burmah, the members of the royal
family, when they die, being embalmed—a custom
brought by Moses from Egypt. The title of Phra
among the Siamese is also imported from Egypt,
being used in both countries as a royal appellation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The inspired Lawgiver proceeded eastward from
the kingdom of Brahma, and entered China. The
inhabitants of this immense tract of land lying along
the sea-shore were savages, ignorant of the arts and
comforts of civilized life. He imparted to them the
knowledge of agriculture and astronomy, arithmetic
and navigation, and all the useful arts and sciences.
He reclaimed them from the darkness of profound
ignorance, and gave them laws for guidance in their
duties towards God and their fellow-beings.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moses also taught these people to read and write;
the writing being in hieroglyphics, similar to that of
Egypt. He established here a form of government
resembling that of the other kingdoms he had
founded on his route. And when he had reclaimed
these savages and raised them to a height
of civilization equal to that of Egypt, he departed,
leaving a colony to continue the good work which
he had begun.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is remarked by Dr. Mason, that “there have
been Jews in China from time immemorial, and that
ancient copies of the Pentateuch, written on sheep-skins,
have been found in their possession.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Since the departure of Moses the kingdom of
China, which he founded, has many times been
invaded by different nations of Western Asia; and
has had conquerors so savage that they ordered all
the books to be burnt, and compelled the people to
adopt many strange customs, which prevail in China
even to this day. So that the Chinese were more
civilized in the days immediately succeeding Moses’
time than they are in this century.</p>

<p class='c006'>The country along the sea-board adjoining China
is Corea; and the Lawgiver visited this country
also before he crossed over to the island of Japan.
The original Coreans were savages, like all their
primitive neighbours; and here the god-like Lawgiver
imparted to the ignorant men the same lessons
he had given in all the countries along his route.
He formed the peninsula of Corea into a dependency
of China; so that its annals are included in the
History of China.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Coreans have a knowledge of the writings of
Moses; and a system of caste prevails as in the
Eastern parts of India. The colonists were, of course,
the nobles of the land. A traveller states:—<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c007'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“The features of a very considerable portion of
the natives I had an opportunity to see during my
travels in the country bore an expression so noble
and so marked, that they might have passed for
Europeans, had they been dressed after our fashion.
This was also most strikingly observable in a great
number of children, whose handsome, regular features,
rosy skin, blue eyes, and auburn hair really
made it so difficult to distinguish them from European
children that at first I could not account for
their looks but by believing them to be of European
descent—an impression which had, of course, to be
abandoned as altogether false and erroneous after
penetrating further into the interior, when appearances
of the same nature became of daily occurrence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From the peninsula of Corea Moses and his followers
crossed over to the beautiful island of Japan,
in the North Pacific Ocean, not far distant from the
continent of Asia. The people inhabiting the numerous
isles which compose the kingdom of Japan were
savages—ignorant and superstitious, like the rest of
the children of Nature, whom the Lawgiver had met
in his journey, and whom he reclaimed from the darkness
of ignorance to the knowledge of God and His
commandments.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here he taught the Japanese as he had other
people; and after giving laws and ordinances for
their guidance, he departed, leaving a colony to govern
the country.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER VIII.</span><br /> <br />MISSION OF MOSES IN THE WEST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Proceeding still further eastward Moses landed on
the western coast of North America. He found the
natives inhabiting this vast tract of land as savage
as those he had left on the continent and the adjacent
islands of Asia—profoundly ignorant of God, living
like the animals around them, and going about as
nude as in the day when they were first created.
The god-like Lawgiver founded an extensive empire
in this wilderness, and brought these savages under
subjection, and taught them all things necessary for
their happiness and well-being. This empire was
Mexico.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this new empire he constructed monuments
resembling those of Upper and Lower Egypt, Nubia
and Ethiopia; he set up statues, built pyramids,
aqueducts, palaces, and bridges. His works he embellished
with sculpture portraying the battles his
forces had fought with the different nations that
opposed their landing to occupy the country. And
he brought his new subjects to the same state of
civilization as the ancient Egyptians of his time.
The following extracts are from the work of a modern
traveller, concerning the pyramids and other ruins of
Mexico:—<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c007'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“We arrived at Chollula after a pleasant ride over
plains covered with corn-fields, interspersed with plantations
of the <i>Agava Americana</i>. This city was,
before the conquest, one of the most considerable
belonging to the ancient Mexicans. It was famed
for its idols, its sanctity, and its pagan worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Teocalli or temple is composed of alternate
layers of clay and sun-burnt brick, forming an immense
pyramid, divided into regular stages, or platforms;
but time, and the growth of the prickly pear,
the tuna, or nopal, and other vegetables, have left
but little of its original form visible, and it now
resembles a natural hill; the high road from Puebla
is cut through a part of it, which serves to show its
internal structure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We ascended by a steep winding road, partly cut
into steps, to a level area of 140 (one hundred and
forty) feet long, on which stands a very neat church,
ninety feet in length, with two towers and a dome;
from this exalted platform the spectator enjoys a
most lovely landscape. We descended with reluctance
the side of this pyramid, whose base is more
extensive than that of the Great Pyramid of Egypt.
It is covered with trees of great variety, some
species of which I had never before seen; but they
had evidently been planted there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On our descent to the plains we visited two
detached masses, constructed, like the great pyramid,
of unburnt brick and clay. The one to the north-east
had been cut or taken away; its broken sides
were so perpendicular as to prevent access to its
summit. The other detached piece has been engraved
by Humbolt, whose figure of the great pyramid conveys
an idea of its ancient rather than its present
state, nor is the church on its summit like the
original.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The corner-stone of the building now occupied
by the lottery-office, and fronting the market for
shoes, is the head of the serpent-idol, of great magnitude,
which I should judge was not, when entire, less
than seventy-feet in length. Under the gateway of
the house, nearly opposite the entrance to the mint,
is a fine statue, in a recumbent posture, of a deity,
bearing the human form, and ornamented with various
symbols; it is about the size of life, and was found a
few years since in digging a well.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The house at the corner of a street at the south-east
of the great square is built upon and in part
supported by a fine circular altar of black basalt,
ornamented with the tail and claws of a gigantic
reptile. In the cloisters behind the Dominican Convent
is a noble specimen of the great serpent idol,
almost perfect, and of fine workmanship; this monstrous
divinity is represented in the act of swallowing
a human victim, which is seen crushed and struggling
in its horrid jaws.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The only works of art of the inhabitants of the
city of Mexico before the conquest, then called
Tenochtitlan, now publicly seen, are the great Calendar
Stone, popularly called Montezuma’s watch, and
the Sacrificial Stone, or the grand altar, once standing
in the great temple before the principal idol. The
former measures twelve feet in diameter, and is cut
from one large block of porous basaltic stone. It is
supposed to have been placed in the roof of the great
temple in the same manner as the Zodiac was in the
temple of Tentyra in Upper Egypt.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c007'><sup>[65]</sup></a> It now stands
against the north-west wall of the cathedral, and is
an attractive object of antiquarian research, and a
striking proof of the perfection the nation to which
it belonged had attained in some of the sciences;
few persons, even of the most enlightened cities of
Europe, of the present day, would be capable of
executing such a work.</p>

<p class='c006'>“From the first moment I beheld it I determined,
if possible, to convey to Europe a fac-simile of so
fine a specimen of Aztec skill. Through the influence
of Don Lucas Alarman, the prime minister, I
obtained permission of the clergy to erect a scaffold
against the cathedral, and took an impression of it
in plaster, which was afterwards carefully packed up,
and with some difficulty conveyed to Vera Cruz.
It has fortunately arrived safely in England, and
now forms one of the subjects of the exhibition of
Ancient Mexico to be seen in the Egyptian Hall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Sacrificial Stone, or altar, is buried in the
square of the cathedral, within a hundred yards of
the Calendar Stone. The upper surface only is
exposed to view, which seems to have been done
designedly. As I had been informed that the sides
were covered with historical sculpture, I applied to
the clergy for the further permission of having the
earth removed from around it, which they not only
granted, but moreover had it performed for me at
their own expense.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I then took casts of the whole. It is twenty-five
feet in circumference, and consists of fifteen groups
of figures, representing the conquests of the warriors
of Mexico over different cities, the names of which
are written over them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After a pleasant ride over a country not very
fertile, we reached the gates of Tescuco. Some time
before approaching the immediate vicinity of the city,
you are apprised that you are near a place of great
antiquity. You pass the large aqueduct for the
supply of the town, which is still in use, and you also
pass the ruins of several stone buildings of great
strength.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On entering the gates, to the right are seen those
artificial tumuli, the teocalli of unburnt brick so
common in most Indian towns, supposed to be
temples, tombs, or places of defence, or perhaps
serving for all these purposes. The foundations and
ruins of temples, fortresses, palaces, and other extensive
buildings, are alone sufficient to attest its former
consequence and splendour; but it is likewise well
known to have been in earlier times the seat of
Mexican literature and art. It was the Athens of
America, and the residence of historians, orators,
poets, artists, and the great men of every department
of the sciences who existed in those days.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a subject for contemplation does this
collection of ruins present to the reflecting mind!
The seat of a powerful monarch, whose subjects (if
we may judge from their works) were probably an
enlightened people, existing and flourishing long
before the continent of America was known to
Europe, and yet a people whose customs, costume,
religion, and architecture strongly resembled those
of an enlightened nation of Africa.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Bullock continues:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“We soon arrived at the foot of the largest pyramid
(at Otumba), and began to ascend. It was less
difficult than we expected, although, the whole way
up, lime and cement are mixed with fallen stones.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c007'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
The terraces are perfectly visible, particularly the
second, which is about thirty-eight feet wide, covered
with a coat of red cement eight or ten inches thick,
composed of small pebble-stones and lime. In many
places, as you ascend, the nopal trees have destroyed
the regularity of the steps, but nowhere injured the
general figure of the square, which is as perfect in
this respect as the Great Pyramid of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We everywhere observed broken pieces of instruments
like knives, arrow and spear-heads, &amp;c. composed
of obsidian, the same as those found on the
small hills of Chollula; and, on reaching the summit,
we found a flat surface of considerable size, but which
has been much broken and disturbed. On the north-east
side, about half-way down, at some remote
period, an opening has been attempted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dr. Oteyza, who has given us the measure of
these Pyramids, makes the base of the largest six
hundred and forty-five feet in length, and one hundred
and seventy-one in perpendicular height. I should
certainly consider that the latter measurement is
considerably under the mark, and that its altitude
must be half its breadth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no doubt that these Mexican pyramids
were built by Moses for the same purpose as those
in Egypt; and that these were similarly finished off
with casing-stones, to preserve the corn from the
effects of the elements, like their prototypes throughout
Egypt. Dr. Robertson in his <cite>History of North
and South America</cite>, says:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“As far as one can gather from their obscure and
inaccurate descriptions, the great temple of Mexico,
the most famous in New Spain, which has been
represented as a magnificent building, raised to such
a height that the ascent to it was by a flight of a
hundred and fourteen steps, was a solid mass of earth
of a square form, faced partly with stone. Its base on
each side extended ninety feet, and decreasing gradually
as it advanced in height, it terminated in a
quadrangle of about thirty feet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In its original state this building would have
terminated in a sharp point, instead of a quadrangle
of such extent; and have been faced entirely with
stone, smoothly polished, from base to summit—resembling
the Egyptian pyramids.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the Spaniards under Cortes, visited Mexico,
“the Empire<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c007'><sup>[67]</sup></a> was at a pitch of grandeur to which
no society ever attained in so short a period. Its
dominion extended from the North to the South
sea, over territories stretching, with some small
interruption, above five hundred leagues from east
to west, and more than two hundred from north to
south, comprehending provinces, not inferior in
fertility, population, and opulence, to any in the
torrid zone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The people were warlike and enterprising, the
authority of the monarch unbounded, and his revenues
considerable. If, with the forces which might
have been suddenly assembled in such an empire,
Montezuma had fallen upon the Spaniards whilst
encamped on a barren unhealthy coast, unsupported
by any ally, without a place of retreat, and destitute
of provisions, it seems to be impossible, even with
all the advantages of their superior discipline and
arms, that they could have stood the shock, and
they must either have perished in such an unequal
contest, or have abandoned the enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Spaniards were received by Montezuma in the
city of Mexico, and Dr. Robertson goes on to say:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“When they drew near the city, about a thousand
persons, who appeared to be of distinction,
came forth to meet them, adorned with plumes and
clad in mantles of fine cotton. Each of these, in his
order, passed by Cortes, and saluted him according
to the mode deemed most respectful and submissive
in their country. They announced the approach of
Montezuma himself, and soon after his harbingers
came in sight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There appeared first two hundred persons in an
uniform dress, with large plumes of feathers, alike
in fashion, marching two and two, in deep silence,
bare-footed, with their eyes fixed on the ground.
These were followed by a company of higher rank,
in their most showy apparel, in the midst of whom
was Montezuma, in a chair or litter richly ornamented
with gold and feathers of various colours.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Four of his principal favourites carried him on
their shoulders, others supported a canopy of curious
workmanship over his head. Before him marched
three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which
they lifted up on high at certain intervals, and at
that signal all the people bowed their heads, and
hid their faces, as unworthy to look on so great
a monarch.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When he drew near, Cortes dismounted, advancing
towards him with officious haste, and in a
respectful posture. At the same time Montezuma
alighted from his chair, and leaning on the arms of
two of his near relations, approached with a slow
and stately pace, his attendants covering the street
with cotton cloths, that he might not touch the
ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cortes accosted him with profound reverence,
after the European fashion. He returned the salutation,
according to the mode of his country, by
touching the earth with his hand, and then kissing
it. This ceremony, the customary expression of
veneration from inferiors towards those who were
above them in rank, appeared such amazing condescension
in a proud monarch, who scarcely deigned
to consider the rest of mankind as of the same species
with himself, that all his subjects firmly believed
those persons, before whom he humbled himself in
this manner, to be something more than human.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Montezuma conducted Cortes to the quarters
which he had prepared for his reception, and immediately
took leave of him, with a politeness not
unworthy of a court more refined. ‘You are now,’
says he, ‘with your brothers in your own house;
refresh yourselves after your fatigue, and be happy
until I return.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“The place allotted to the Spaniards for their
lodging was a house built by the father of Montezuma.
It was surrounded by a stone wall, with
towers at proper distances, which served for defence
as well as for ornament, and its apartments and
courts were so large as to accommodate both the
Spaniards and their Indian allies.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the evening, Montezuma returned to visit his
guests with the same pomp as in their first interview,
and brought presents of such value, not only
to Cortes and to his officers, but even to the private
men, as proved the liberality of the monarch to be
suitable to the opulence of his kingdom. A long
conference ensued, in which Cortes learned what
was the opinion of Montezuma with respect to the
Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was an established tradition, he told him,
among the Mexicans, that their ancestors came
originally from a remote region, and conquered
the provinces now subject to his dominion: that
after they were settled there, the great captain
who conducted this colony returned to his own
country, promising that at some future period his
descendants should visit them, assume the government,
and reform their constitution and laws; that
from what he had heard and seen of Cortes and his
followers he was convinced they were the very
persons whose appearance the Mexican traditions
and prophecies taught them to expect; that accordingly
he had received them, not as strangers, but as
relations of the same blood and parentage, and
desired that they might consider themselves as
masters in his dominions, for both himself and his
subjects should be ready to comply with their will,
and even to prevent their wishes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cortes made a reply in his usual style, with
respect to the dignity and power of his sovereign,
and his intention in sending him into that country;
artfully endeavouring so to frame his discourse that
it might coincide as much as possible with the idea
which Montezuma had formed concerning the origin
of the Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mexico, or Tenuchtitlan, as it was anciently
called by the natives, is situated in a large plain,
environed by mountains of such height, that, though
within the torrid zone, the temperature of its climate
is mild and healthful. All the moisture which
descends from the high grounds is collected in
several lakes, the two largest of which, of about
ninety miles in circuit, communicate with each
other. The waters of the one are fresh, those of
the others brackish. On the banks of the latter, and
on some small islands adjoining to them, the capital
of Montezuma’s empire was built.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The access to the city was by artificial causeways
or streets formed of stones and earth, about
thirty feet in breadth. As the waters of the lake
during the rainy season overflowed the flat country,
these causeways were of considerable length. That
of Tacuba, on the west, extended a mile and a half;
that of Tepeaca, on the north-west, three miles; that
of Cuoyacan, towards the south, six miles.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On the east there was no causeway, and they
could be approached only by canoes. In each of
these causeways were openings at proper intervals,
through which the waters flowed, and over these
beams of timber were laid, which, being covered with
earth, the causeway or street had everywhere an
uniform appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As the approaches to the city were singular, its
construction was remarkable. Not only the temples
of their gods, but the houses belonging to the
monarch, and to persons of distinction, were of such
dimensions, that, in comparison with any other buildings
which had been hitherto discovered in America,
they might be termed magnificent. The habitations
of the common people were mean, resembling the
huts of other Indians. But they were all placed in
a regular manner, on the banks of the canals which
passed through the city in some of its districts, or
in the sides of the streets which intersected it in
other quarters.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In several places were large openings or squares,
one of which, allotted for the great market, is said to
have been so spacious that forty or fifty thousand
persons carried on traffic there. In this city, the pride
of the New World, and the noblest monument of the
industry and art of man, the Spaniards reckon that
there were at least sixty thousand inhabitants.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The explanation given to the Spaniards by the
King of Mexico of his conduct in receiving them in
the manner he did—humbling himself in the presence
of his European visitors—proves that the
founders of the Mexican Empire were white men,
similar to the Spaniards; and, in firm belief in the
promise of the great chief—that at some future time
his descendants would visit the Mexicans—the king
made up his mind to deliver the empire into the
hands of Cortes, as the representative of that chief.</p>

<p class='c006'>So that, even when Montezuma was kept a
prisoner, and ill-treated by these Spaniards, he
submitted with the utmost humility to every
indignity without offering the slightest opposition.
He only discovered his mistake regarding the
identity of these men when Cortes tried to impose
the forms of the Roman Catholic religion, and placed
the image of the Virgin Mary in their great temple
in Mexico. Then, and only then, did he resent, and
allow the Mexican nobles to assert their liberty, and
to take up arms against their cruel invaders, who
had broken every international law, and usurped the
power of their kingdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cruelty and the superstition of the Spaniards
in New Spain are well known throughout the civilized
world, so that it is needless to recount them
here. These usurpers did all in their power to
destroy every monument of the ancient Mexicans,
under the ignorant impression that every building
was a heathen temple, and every statue the image of
a pagan god, to whom prayers and sacrifices were
offered. They even built churches on the tops of
some of the large Pyramids, thinking that these
were temples, erected for the performance of idolatrous
worship!</p>

<p class='c006'>The inspired Law-giver, after establishing a firm
government, with good laws and regulations for its
continuance, left a colony in power over the conquered
natives of the soil, and, departing from
Mexico, landed on the shores of the southern
continent of America, where he founded the extensive
Empire of Peru.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the time of Pizarro’s arrival in Peru the
dominion of its sovereign extended in length, from
north to south, above fifteen hundred miles along
the Pacific Ocean; its breadth from east to west was
much less, it being uniformly bounded by the vast
ridge of the Andes, stretching from one extremity of
the country to the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Moses and his followers landed, the country
was inhabited, like the rest of the primitive world,
by independent tribes of savages, differing from each
other in manners, and in their rude forms of polity.
He, however, brought them all under his government;
imparted to them the knowledge of God;
gave them laws; and instructed the men in agriculture
and other useful arts, while the women were
taught to spin and weave, as in China and other
kingdoms and empires that he had already founded.
So that, as by the labour of the one sex subsistence
became less precarious, by that of the other life was
rendered more comfortable.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a tradition preserved among the Peruvians,
that when their ancestors were mere savages
roaming the woods, without clothing, or any settled
place of residence, their condition became changed
under the following circumstances:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“After they had struggled for several ages with
the hardships and calamities which are inevitable in
such a state, and when no circumstance seemed to
indicate the approach of any uncommon effort towards
improvement, we are told that there appeared,
on the banks of the Lake Titiaca, a man and a
woman of majestic form, clothed in decent garments.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They declared themselves to be children of the
sun, sent by their beneficent parent, who beheld with
pity the miseries of the human race, to instruct and
to reclaim them. At their persuasion, enforced by
reverence for the divinity in whose name they were
supposed to speak, several of the dispersed savages
united together, received their commands as heavenly
injunctions, and followed them to Cuzco, where they
settled and began to lay the foundations of a city.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Manco Capac and Mama Ocollo, for such were
the names of these extraordinary personages, having
thus collected some wandering tribes, formed that
social union which, by multiplying the desires and
uniting the efforts of the human species, excites
industry, and leads to improvement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After securing the objects of first necessity in an
infant state, by providing food, raiment, and habitations
for the rude people of whom he took charge,
Manco Capac turned his attention towards introducing
such laws and policy as might perpetuate
their happiness. By his institutions the various
relations in private life were established, and the
duties resulting from them prescribed with such
propriety, as gradually formed a barbarous people to
decency of manners.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In public administration, the functions of persons
in authority were so precisely defined, and the subordination
of those under their jurisdiction maintained
with such a steady hand, that the society in which
he presided soon assumed the aspect of a regular and
well governed state.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thus, according to the Indian tradition, was
founded the empire of the Incas, or Lords of Peru.
At first its extent was small. The territory of Manco
Capac did not reach above eight leagues from Cuzco.
But within its narrow precincts he exercised absolute
and uncontrolled authority. His successors, as their
dominions extended, arrogated a similar jurisdiction
over the new subjects which they acquired; the
despotism of Asia was not more complete.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Incas were not only obeyed as monarchs,
but revered as divinities. Their blood was held to
be sacred, and, by prohibiting intermarriages with
the people, was never contaminated by mixing with
that of any other race. The family, thus separated
from the rest of the nation, was distinguished by
peculiarities in dress and ornaments, which it was
unlawful for others to assume. The monarch himself
appeared with ensigns of royalty reserved for him
alone; and received from his subjects marks of
obsequious homage and respect, which approached
almost to adoration.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, among the Peruvians, this unbounded
power of their monarchs seems to have been uniformly
accompanied with attention to the good of
their subjects. It was not the rage of conquest, if
we may believe the accounts of their countrymen,
that prompted the Incas to extend their dominions,
but the desire of diffusing the blessings of civilization,
and the knowledge of the arts which they
possessed, among the barbarous people whom they
reduced. During a succession of twelve monarchs,
it is said that not one deviated from this beneficent
character.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c007'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>At the time Pizarro arrived in Peru there was a
civil war between two Incas; and he was invited by
one of these to visit Caxamalca as a friend and ally.
The following is an account of his visit:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“On entering Caxamalca, Pizarro took possession
of a large court, on one side of which was a house
which the Spanish historians call a palace of the
Inca, and on the other a temple of the sun, the
whole surrounded with a strong rampart or wall of
earth. When he had posted his troops in this
advantageous station, he dispatched his brother
Ferdinand and Hernando Soto to the camp of
Atahualpa, which was about a league distant from
the town.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He instructed them to confirm the declaration
which he had formerly made of his pacific disposition,
and to desire an interview with the Inca, that he
might explain more fully the intention of the
Spaniards in visiting his country. They were
treated with all the respectful hospitality usual
among the Peruvians in the reception of their most
cordial friends, and Atahualpa promised to visit the
Spanish commander next day in his quarters.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The decent deportment of the Peruvian monarch,
the order of his court, and the reverence with which
his subjects approached his person and obeyed his
commands, astonished those Spaniards who had
never met in America with anything more dignified
than the petty cazique of a barbarous tribe. But
their eyes were still more powerfully attracted by
the vast profusion of wealth which they observed in
the Inca’s camp.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The rich ornaments worn by him and his
attendants, the vessels of gold and silver in which
the repast offered to them was served up, the multitude
of utensils of every kind formed of those precious
metals, opened prospects far exceeding any idea of
opulence that a European of the sixteenth century
could form.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Early in the morning the Peruvian camp was
all in motion. But as Atahualpa was so solicitous
to appear with the greatest splendour and magnificence
in his first interview with the strangers, the
preparations for this were so tedious, that the day
was far advanced before he began his march. Even
then, lest the order of the procession should be
deranged, he moved so slowly, that the Spaniards
became impatient, and apprehensive that some suspicion
of their intention might be the cause of this
delay. In order to remove this, Pizarro despatched
one of his officers with fresh assurances of his friendly
disposition.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At length the Inca approached. First of all
appeared four hundred men, in a uniform dress,
as harbingers to clear the way before him. He
himself, sitting on a throne or couch adorned with
plumes of various colours, and almost covered with
plates of gold and silver enriched with precious
stones, was carried on the shoulders of his principal
attendants.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Behind him came some chief officers of his
court, carried in the same manner. Several bands
of singers and dancers accompanied the cavalcade,
and the whole plain was covered with troops,
amounting to more than thirty thousand men.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As the Inca drew near the Spanish quarters,
Father Vincent Valverde, chaplain to the expedition,
advanced, with a crucifix in one hand and a breviary
in the other, and in a long discourse explained to him
the doctrine of the Creation, the fall of Adam, the
incarnation, the sufferings and resurrection of Jesus
Christ, the appointment of St. Peter as God’s vicegerent
on earth, the transmission of his apostolic
power by succession to the popes, the donation made
to the King of Castile, by Pope Alexander, of all the
regions of the New World.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In consequence of all this, he required Atahualpa
to embrace the Christian faith, to acknowledge the
supreme jurisdiction of the Pope, and to submit to
the King of Castile as his lawful sovereign; promising,
if he complied instantly with this requisition,
that the Castilian monarch would protect his
dominions, and permit him to continue in the
exercise of his royal authority; but if he should
impiously refuse to obey this summons, he denounced
war against him in his master’s name, and
threatened him with the most dreadful effects of his
vengeance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This strange harangue, unfolding deep mysteries,
and alluding to unknown facts, of which no power of
eloquence could have conveyed at once a distinct
idea to an American, was so lamely translated by an
unskilful interpreter, little acquainted with the idiom
of the Spanish tongue, and incapable of expressing
himself with propriety in the language of the Inca,
that its general tenor was altogether incomprehensible
to Atahualpa. Some parts in it, of more obvious
meaning, filled him with astonishment and indignation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“His reply, however, was temperate. He began
with observing that he was lord of the dominions
over which he reigned by hereditary succession; and
added, that he could not conceive how a foreign
priest should pretend to dispose of territories which
did not belong to him; that if such a preposterous
grant had been made, he, who was the rightful
possessor, refused to confirm it; that he had no
inclination to renounce the religious institutions
established by his ancestors; nor would he forsake
the service of the sun, the immortal divinity whom
he and his people revered, in order to worship the
god of the Spaniards, who was subject to death;
that with respect to other matters contained in his
discourse, as he had never heard of them before,
and did not understand their meaning, he desired
to know where the priest had learned things so
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘In this book,’ answered Valverde, reaching out
to him his breviary. The Inca opened it eagerly,
and turning over the leaves, lifted it to his ear.
‘This,’ says he, ‘is silent; it tells me nothing’;
and threw it with disdain to the ground. The
enraged monk, running towards his countrymen,
cried out, ‘To arms, Christians! to arms! the word
of God is insulted; avenge this profanation on those
impious dogs!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pizarro, who, during this long conference, had
with difficulty restrained his soldiers, eager to seize
the rich spoils of which they had now so near a view,
immediately gave the signal of assault. At once the
martial music struck up, the cannon and muskets
began to fire, the horse sallied out fiercely to the
charge, the infantry rushed on sword in hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Peruvians, astonished at the suddenness of
an attack which they did not expect, and dismayed
with the destructive effect of the fire-arms, and the
irresistible impression of the cavalry, fled with
universal consternation on every side, without attempting
either to annoy the enemy or to defend
themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pizarro, at the head of his chosen band, advanced
directly towards the Inca; and though his nobles
crowded around him with officious zeal, and fell in
numbers at his feet, while they vied one with another
in sacrificing their own lives, that they might cover
the sacred person of their sovereign, the Spaniards
soon penetrated to the royal seat; and Pizarro,
seizing the Inca by the arm, dragged him to the
ground, and carried him as a prisoner to his
quarters.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The fate of the monarch increased the precipitate
flight of his followers. The Spaniards
pursued them towards every quarter, and with
deliberate and unrelenting barbarity continued to
slaughter wretched fugitives who never once offered
to resist. The carnage did not cease until the close
of the day. About four thousand Peruvians were
killed. Not a single Spaniard fell, nor was one
wounded but Pizarro himself, whose hand was
slightly hurt by one of his own soldiers, while
struggling eagerly to lay hold on the Inca.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The plunder of the field was rich beyond any
idea which the Spaniards had yet formed concerning
the wealth of Peru, and they were so transported
with the value of the acquisition, as well as the
greatness of their success, that they passed the night
in the extravagant exultation natural to indigent
adventurers on such an extraordinary change of
fortune.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At first the captive monarch could hardly
believe a calamity, which he so little expected, to
be real. But he soon felt all the misery of his fate,
and the dejection into which he sank was in proportion
to the height of grandeur from which he had
fallen. Pizarro, afraid of losing all the advantages
which he hoped to derive from the possession of such
a prisoner, laboured to console him with professions
of kindness and respect, that corresponded ill with
his actions.</p>

<p class='c006'>“By residing among the Spaniards, the Inca
quickly discovered their ruling passion, which,
indeed, they were nowise solicitous to conceal, and,
by applying to that, made an attempt to recover his
liberty. He offered as a ransom what astonished
the Spaniards, even after all they now knew concerning
the opulence of his kingdom. The apartment
in which he was confined was twenty-two feet
in length and sixteen in breadth; he undertook to
fill it with vessels of gold as high as he could
reach.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pizarro closed eagerly with the tempting proposal,
and a line was drawn upon the walls of the
chamber, to mark the stipulated height to which
the treasure was to rise. Atahualpa, transported
with having obtained some prospect of liberty, took
measures instantly for fulfilling his part of the
agreement, by sending messengers to Cuzco, Quito,
and other places, where gold had been amassed in
largest quantities, either for adorning the temples, or
the houses of the Inca, to bring what was necessary
for completing his ransom directly to Caxamalca.
Though Atahualpa was now in the custody of his
enemies, yet so much were the Peruvians accustomed
to respect every mandate issued by their sovereign,
that his orders were executed with the greatest
alacrity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Soothed with hopes of recovering his liberty by
this means, the subjects of the Inca were afraid of
endangering his life by forming any other scheme
for his relief; and though the force of the empire
was still entire, no preparations were made and no
army assembled to avenge their own wrongs or those
of their monarch. The Spaniards remained in Caxamalca
tranquil and unmolested. Small detachments
of their number marched into remote provinces of the
empire, and instead of meeting with any opposition,
were everywhere received with marks of the most
submissive respect.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Indians daily arrived at Caxamalca from
different parts of the kingdom, loaded with treasure.
A great part of the stipulated quantity was now
amassed, and Atahualpa assured the Spaniards that
the only thing which prevented the whole from being
brought in was the remoteness of the provinces
where it was deposited.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But such vast piles of gold presented continually
to the view of needy soldiers, had so inflamed
their avarice, that it was impossible any longer to
restrain their impatience to obtain possession of this
rich booty. Orders were given for melting down
the whole, except some pieces of curious fabric,
reserved as a present for the Emperor. After setting
apart the fifth due to the crown, and a hundred
thousand pesos as a donation to the soldiers which
arrived with Almagro, there remained one million
five hundred and twenty-eight thousand five hundred
pesos to Pizarro and his followers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The festival of St. James, the patron saint of
Spain, was the day (July 25, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1533) chosen for
the partition of this enormous sum, and the manner
of conducting it strongly marks the strange alliance
of fanaticism and avarice, which I have more than
once had occasion to point out as a striking feature
in the character of the conquerors of the New World.
Though assembled to divide the spoils of an innocent
people, procured by deceit, extortion, and cruelty,
the transaction began with a solemn invocation of
the name of God, as if they could have expected the
guidance of Heaven in distributing those wages of
iniquity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In this division above eight thousand pesos, at
that time not inferior in effective value to as many
pounds sterling in the present century, fell to the
share of each horseman, and half that sum to each
foot-soldier. Pizarro himself, and his officers, received
dividends in proportion to the dignity of their
rank.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Spaniards having divided among them the
treasure amassed for the Inca’s ransom, he insisted
with them to fulfil their promise of setting him at
liberty. But nothing was further from Pizarro’s
thoughts. During his long service in the New
World, he had imbibed those ideas and maxims of
his fellow soldiers, which led them to consider its
inhabitants as an inferior race, neither worthy of
the name nor entitled to the rights of men. In his
compact with Atahualpa, he had no other object than
to amuse his captive with such a prospect of recovering
his liberty as might induce him to lend all the
aid of his authority towards collecting the wealth of
his kingdom. Having now accomplished this, he no
longer regarded his plighted faith; and at the very
time when the credulous prince hoped to be replaced
on his throne, he had secretly resolved to bereave him
of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Many circumstances seemed to have concurred
in prompting him to this action, the most criminal
and atrocious that stains the Spanish name, amidst
all the deeds of violence committed in carrying on
the conquest of the New World. Though Pizarro
had seized the Inca, in imitation of Cortes’s conduct
towards the Mexican monarch, he did not possess
talents for carrying on the same artful plan of policy.
Destitute of the temper and address requisite for
gaining the confidence of his prisoner, he never
reaped all the advantages which might have been
derived from being master of his person and
authority.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Atahualpa was, indeed, a prince of greater
abilities and discernment than Montezuma, and
seems to have penetrated more thoroughly into the
character and intentions of the Spaniards. Mutual
suspicion and distrust accordingly took place between
them. The strict attention with which it was necessary
to guard a captive of such importance, greatly
increased the fatigue of military duty. The utility
of keeping him appeared inconsiderable; and Pizarro
felt him as an encumbrance from which he wished
to be delivered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But in order to give some colour of justice to
this violent action, and that he himself might be
exempted from standing singly responsible for the
commission of it, Pizarro resolved to try the Inca
with all the formalities observed in the criminal
courts of Spain. Pizarro himself, and Almagro, with
two assistants, were appointed judges, with full power
to acquit or to condemn; an attorney-general was
named to carry on the prosecution in the King’s
name; counsellors were chosen to assist the prisoner
in his defence, and clerks were ordered to record the
proceedings of court.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Before this strange tribunal, a charge was
exhibited still more amazing. It consisted of various
articles: that Atahualpa, though a bastard, had dispossessed
the rightful owner of the throne, and
usurped the regal power; that he had put his brother
and lawful sovereign to death; that he was an
idolater, and had not only permitted, but commanded
the offering of human sacrifices; that he had a great
number of concubines; that since his imprisonment
he had wasted and embezzled the treasures which
now belonged of right to the conquerors; that he
had incited his subjects to take arms against the
Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On these heads of accusation, some of which are
so ludicrous, others so absurd, that the effrontery of
Pizarro in making them the foundation of a serious
procedure is not less surprising than his injustice,
did this strange court go on to try the sovereign of
a great empire, over whom he had no jurisdiction.
With respect to each of the articles, witnesses were
examined; but as they delivered their evidence in
their native tongue, Philippillo had it in his power
to give their words whatever turn best suited his
malevolent intentions. To judges predetermined in
their opinion, this evidence appeared sufficient. They
pronounced Atahualpa guilty, and condemned him to
be burnt alive. Friar Valverde prostituted the
authority of his sacred function to confirm this
sentence, and by his signature warranted it to be just.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Astonished at his fate, Atahualpa endeavoured to
avert it by tears, by promises, and by entreaties that
he might be sent to Spain, where a monarch would
be the arbiter of his lot. But pity never touched
the unfeeling heart of Pizarro. He ordered him to
be led instantly to execution; and, what added to
the bitterness of his last moments, the same monk
who had just ratified his doom offered to console, and
attempted to convert him. The most powerful argument
Valverde employed to prevail with him to
embrace the Christian faith, was a promise of mitigation
in his punishment. The dread of a cruel death
extorted from the trembling victim a desire of receiving
baptism. The ceremony was performed; and
Atahualpa, instead of being burnt, was strangled at
the stake!</p>

<p class='c006'>“On the death of Atahualpa, Pizarro invested one
of his sons with the ensigns of royalty, hoping that
a young man without experience might prove a more
passive instrument in his hands than an ambitious
monarch, who had been accustomed to independent
command.”</p>

<p class='c006'>These accounts of the wealth and the fate of these
two monarchs—the one of the extensive empire of
Mexico, and the other of the equally powerful
dominions of Peru—recall to mind the power and
wealth of Solomon, the King of Israel. These three
kingdoms were founded by Moses, and peopled and
ruled by the descendants of Abraham. The wealth
of Solomon was so great that it is recorded in the
Bible that “he made silver and gold at Jerusalem as
plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the
sycamore trees that are in the vale for abundance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The display made by the two American sovereigns
of their grandeur and riches before foreigners, and
the consequences of their pride and ostentation, have
a parallel in the scriptures.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of
Baladan, King of Babylon, sent letters and a present
unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had
been sick. And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and
shewed them all the house of his precious things, the
silver and the gold, and the spices, and the precious
ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all
that was found in his treasures; there was nothing
in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah
shewed them not.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then came Isaiah the prophet unto King Hezekiah,
and said unto him, What said these men? and
from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah
said, They are come from a far country, even from
Babylon. And he said, What have they seen in
thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things
that are in mine house have they seen; there is
nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed
them. And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the
word of the Lord. Behold, the days come that
all that is in thine house, and all that which thy
fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be
carried into Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith the
Lord.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c007'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The words of Isaiah the prophet, addressed to King
Hezekiah, could have been as appositely addressed to
King Montezuma and to his neighbour and kinsman
Atahualpa; for they were equally applicable, and
the words came true in all three cases. As the
Babylonians conquered and took possession of Judea,
so did the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moses, the founder of these several empires in
different parts of the earth, foresaw the power and
opulence to which they would attain in the course of
time, and forbade the colonists from having intercourse
with the outer world, who were strangers to
them, knowing that they would be envied by them.
For wherever indigent adventurers have been admitted
by the rulers of these empires, they have been
deceived, and their possessions carried away, as the
prophet so graphically described to King Hezekiah.</p>

<p class='c006'>The historian of North and South America continues:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The violent convulsions into which the empire
had been thrown, first by the civil war between the
two brothers, and then by the invasion of the
Spaniards, had not only deranged the order of the
Peruvian Government, but almost dissolved its frame.
When they beheld their monarch a captive in the
power of strangers, and at last suffering an ignominious
death, the people in several provinces, as if
they had been set free from every restraint of law
and decency, broke out in the most licentious excesses.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So many descendants of the sun, after being
treated with the utmost indignity, had been cut off by
Atahualpa that not only their influence in the state
diminished with their number, but the accustomed
reverence for that sacred race sensibly decreased.
In consequence of this state of things, ambitious
men in different parts of the empire aspired to independent
authority, and usurped jurisdiction to which
they had no title. The general who commanded for
Atahualpa in Quito, seized the brother and children
of his master, put them to a cruel death, and, disclaiming
any connection with either Inca, endeavoured
to establish a separate kingdom for himself.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c007'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The Spaniards eventually became masters of the
whole empire, and in their endeavours to obliterate
every record of its past history they burned everything
they found which had any hieroglyphics or
painting on it. Though only the ruins of monuments
remain, yet these attest the superior ingenuity
of the Peruvians. Ruins of sacred or royal buildings
are found in every province of the empire, and by
their great number demonstrate that they are monuments
of a powerful people. They appear to have
been edifices of various dimensions; some of a
moderate size, many of immense extent, but all
remarkable for solidity, and resembling each other in
style of architecture.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The temple of Pachacamac, together with a
palace of the Inca, and a fortress, were so connected
together as to form one great structure, above half a
league in circuit. In this prodigious pile the same
singular taste in building is conspicuous as in other
works of the Peruvians.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The land of the Peruvians and the Mexicans contained
the precious metals in greater abundance than
any other part of America; and Moses taught them to
obtain gold by searching in the channels of rivers,
or washing the earth in which particles of it were
contained. But in order to procure silver, under his
instruction, they exerted no inconsiderable degree of
skill and invention. They hollowed deep caverns in
the banks of rivers, and the sides of mountains, and
exhausted such veins as did not dip suddenly beyond
their reach. In other places, where the vein lay
near the surface, they dug pits to such a depth that
the person who worked below could throw out the
ore, or hand it up in baskets. Moses taught them,
moreover, the art of smelting and refining, either by
the simple application of fire, or, where the ore was
more stubborn, and impregnated with foreign substances,
by placing it in small ovens or furnaces, so
constructed on high ground that the draught of air
performed the functions of a bellows. By this
simple device the purer ores were smelted with
facility; and the quantity of silver in Peru was so
considerable that many of the utensils commonly
employed were made of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the land of Midian, where the Law-giver dwelt
for many years, there are remains of similar caverns
and pits where mines of the precious metal have been
worked, which attest his ingenuity and skill.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the armoury<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c007'><sup>[71]</sup></a> of the royal palace at Madrid are
shown suits of armour, which are called Montezuma’s.
They are composed of thin lacquered copper-plates.
In the opinion of very intelligent judges, they are evidently
eastern. The forms of the silver ornaments
upon them, representing dragons, &amp;c., may be considered
as confirmation of this.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The only unquestionable specimen of Mexican art
that I know of in Great Britain, is a cup of very
fine gold, which is said to have belonged to Montezuma.
It weighs 5 oz. 12 dwt. Three drawings of
it were exhibited to the Society of Antiquaries, June
10, 1765. A man’s head is represented on the cup.
On one side the full face, on the other the profile, on
the third the back parts of the head. The relievo
is said to have been produced by pinching the inside
of the cup, so as to make the representation of a
face on the outside. The features are gross, but
represented with some degree of art. This cup was
purchased by Edward, Earl of Orford, while he lay
in the harbour of Cadiz with the fleet under his command,
and is now in the possession of his grandson,
Lord Archer. I am indebted for this information
to my respectable and ingenious friend Mr. Barrington.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As the Mexican paintings are the most curious
monument extant of the earliest mode of writing, it
will not be improper to give some account of the
means by which they were preserved from the general
wreck of every work of art in America, and communicated
to the public. For the most early and complete
collection of these published by Purchas, we
are indebted to the attention of that curious inquirer,
Hakluyt.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don Antonio Mendoza, viceroy of New Spain,
having deemed those paintings a proper present for
Charles V., the ship in which they were sent to
Spain was taken by a French cruiser, and they came
into the possession of Thevet, the King’s geographer,
who, having travelled himself into the New World,
and described one of its provinces, was a curious
observer of whatever tended to illustrate the manners
of the Americans.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On his death they were purchased by Hakluyt, at
that time chaplain of the English ambassador to
the French court; and being left by him to Purchas,
were published at the desire of the learned antiquary
Sir Henry Spelman. They were translated
from English into French by Melchizedeck Thevenot,
and published in his collection of voyages, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1683.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The second specimen of Mexican picture-writing
was published by Dr. Francis Gemelli Carreri, in
two copper-plates. The first is a map, or representation
of the progress of the ancient Mexicans<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c007'><sup>[72]</sup></a> on
their first arrival in the country, and of the various
stations in which they settled, before they founded
the capital of their empire in the lake of Mexico.
The second is a chronological wheel, or circle, representing
the manner in which they computed and
marked their cycle of fifty-two years. He received
both from Don Carlos de Siguenza y Congorra, a
diligent collector of ancient Mexican documents.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But as it seems now to be a received opinion
(founded, as far as I know, on no good evidence)
that Carreri was never out of Italy, and that his
famous <cite>Giro del Mundo</cite> is an account of a fictitious
voyage, I have not mentioned these paintings in the
text. They have, however, manifestly the appearance
of being Mexican productions, and are allowed
to be so by Boturini, who was well qualified to determine
whether they were genuine or supposititious.
Mr. Clavigero likewise admits them to be genuine
paintings of the ancient Mexicans. To me they
always appeared to be so, though, from my desire
to rest no part of my narrative upon questionable
authority, I did not refer to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The style of painting in the former is considerably
more perfect than any other specimen of Mexican
design; but as the original is said to have been
much defaced by time, I suspect that it has been
improved by some touches from the hand of an European
artist. The chronological wheel is a just delineation
of the Mexican mode of computing time, as
described by Acosta. It seems to resemble one
which that learned Jesuit had seen; and if it be admitted
as a genuine monument, it proves that the
Mexicans had artificial or arbitrary characters, which
represented several things besides numbers. Each
month is there represented by a symbol expressive
of some work or rite peculiar to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The third specimen of Mexican painting was
discovered by another Italian. In 1736, Lorenzo
Boturini Benaduci set out for New Spain, and was
led by several incidents to study the language of the
Mexicans, and to collect the remains of their historical
monuments. He persisted nine years in his
researches, with the enthusiasm of a projector and
the patience of an antiquary.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In 1746 he published, at Madrid, <a id='idea' name='idea' /><cite>Idea de una Nueva
Historia General de la America Septentrional</cite>, containing
an account of the result of his inquiries; and
he added to it a catalogue of his American historical
Museum, arranged under thirty-six different heads.
His idea of a New History appears to me the work
of a whimsical, credulous man. But his catalogue
of Mexican maps, paintings, tribute-rolls, calendars,
&amp;c., is much larger than one could have expected.
Unfortunately a ship, in which he had sent a considerable
part of them to Europe, was taken by an
English privateer during the war between Great
Britain and Spain, which commenced in the year
1739; and it is probable that they perished by falling
into the hands of ignorant captors.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Boturini himself incurred the displeasure of the
Spanish court, and died in an hospital in Madrid.
The history, of which the <cite>Idea, &amp;c.</cite>, was only a prospectus,
was never published. The remainder of his
Museum seems to have been dispersed. Some part
of it came into the possession of the present Archbishop
of Toledo, when he was primate of New
Spain; and he published from it that curious tribute-roll
which I have mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The only other collection of Mexican paintings,
as far as I can learn, is in the Imperial Library at
Vienna. By order of their imperial majesties, I have
obtained such a specimen of these as I desired, in
eight paintings made with so much fidelity that I
am informed the copies could hardly be distinguished
from the originals. According to a note in this
Codex Mexicanus, it appears to have been a present
from Emanuel, King of Portugal, to Pope Clement
VII., who died <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1533. After passing through
the hands of several illustrious proprietors, it fell
into those of Cardinal of Saxe-Eisenach, who presented
it to the Emperor Leopold. These paintings
are manifestly Mexican, but they are in a style very
different from any of the former. An engraving
has been made of one of them. Were it an object of
sufficient importance, it might, perhaps, be possible,
by recourse to the plates of Purchas, and the Archbishop
of Toledo, as a key, to form plausible conjectures
concerning the meaning of this picture.
Many of the figures are evidently similar. The targets
and darts, are almost in the same form with
those published by Purchas. The figures of temples,
nearly resemble those in Purchas and in Lorenzana.
A bale of mantles, or cotton cloths, is also
shown, the figure of which occurs almost in every plate
of Purchas and Lorenzana; and there appear to be
Mexican captains in their war-dress, the fantastic
ornaments of which resemble the figures in Purchas.
I should suppose this picture to be a tribute-roll,
as the mode of noting numbers occurs frequently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“According to Boturini the mode of computation
by the number of knots was known to the Mexicans
as well as to the Peruvians, and the manner in
which the number of units is represented in the
Mexican paintings in my possession seems to confirm
this opinion. They plainly resemble a string of
knots on a cord or slender rope.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Since I published the former edition, Mr. Waddilove,
who is still pleased to continue his friendly
attention to procure me information, has discovered,
in the library of the Escurial, a volume in folio, consisting
of forty sheets of a kind of paste-board,
each the size of a common sheet of writing-paper,
with great variety of uncouth and whimsical figures
of Mexican painting, in very fresh colours, and with
an explanation in Spanish to most of them. The
first twenty-two sheets are the signs of the months,
days, &amp;c. About the middle of each sheet are two
or more large figures for the month, surrounded by
the signs of the days. The last eighteen sheets are
not so filled with figures. They seem to be signs of
deities, and images of various objects.</p>

<p class='c006'>“According to this Calendar in the Escurial, the
Mexican year contained 286 days, divided into 22
months of 13 days. Each day is represented by a
different sign, taken from some natural object, a
serpent, a dog, a lizard, a reed, a house, &amp;c. The
signs of days in the Calendar of the Escurial are
precisely the same with those mentioned by Boturini,
<cite>Idea, &amp;c.</cite>, p. 45.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, if we may give credit to that author, the
Mexican year contained 360 days, divided into 18
months of 20 days. The order of days in every
month was computed, according to him, first by
what he calls a tridecenary progression of days from
one to thirteen, in the same manner as in the Calendar
of the Escurial, and then by a septenary progression
of days from one to seven, making in all twenty.
In this Calendar not only the signs which distinguish
each day, but the qualities supposed to be peculiar
to each month, are marked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The paste-board, or whatever substance it may
be on which the Calendar in the Escurial is painted,
seems, by Mr. Waddilove’s description of it, to
resemble nearly that in the Imperial Library in
Vienna. In several particulars the figures bear some
likeness to those in the plate which I have published.
The figures ... which induced me
to conjecture that this painting might be a tribute-roll
similar to those published by Purchas and the
Archbishop of Toledo, Mr. Waddilove supposed to
be signs of days; and I have such confidence in the
accuracy of his observations as to conclude his opinion
to be well founded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It appears, from the characters in which the
explanations of the figures are written, that this
curious monument of Mexican art had been obtained
soon after the conquest of the Empire. It is singular
that it should never have been mentioned by any
Spanish author.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The following are the various modes in which the
Mexicans contributed towards the support of government,
modes resembling the revenue system of Egypt
in ancient times. Some persons of the first order
were exempted from payment of tribute, but at the
same time were bound to personal service in war,
and to follow the banner of their sovereign with
their vassals. The immediate vassals of the crown
not only contributed by personal military service,
but also paid a certain proportion of the produce of
their lands in kind. Those who held offices of honour
or trust paid a certain share of the emoluments
derived therefrom.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each “association” cultivated some part of the
common field allotted to it, for the behoof of the
crown, and deposited the produce in the royal
granaries. Some part of whatever was brought to
the public markets, whether fruits of the earth or
the various productions of artists and manufacturers,
was demanded for the public use, and the merchants
who paid this tax were exempted from every other.
The peasants were bound to cultivate certain districts
in every province, which may be considered
as crown lands, and brought the increase into public
storehouses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the sovereign received some part of whatever
was useful or valuable in the country, whether
it was the natural production of the soil, or the result
of the industry of the people. Yet what each contributed
towards the support of government was
inconsiderable, the value of it in money being not
more than about eighteen-pence or two shillings per
head.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER IX.</span><br /> <br />GRANARIES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The storehouses or granaries now in use in Mexico,
Peru, and other empires, are not the Pyramids
which were built and used in the time of Joseph
and Moses. A recent traveller gives the following
description of a modern granary situated near Canton,
in China:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here we saw a large magazine for grain; it was a
quadrangular building about 350 feet each way, lined
on the outside with plank, and on the whole appeared
well adapted for the intended purpose. Such depôts
for corn, they (the Chinese) tell us, are very common
everywhere, yet, except in this instance, they have
hitherto escaped our notice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From what the same traveller says about some
remarkable rocks that he saw in China, there appears
to be every likelihood of finding pyramids in that
country which, built by Moses and his followers
during their sojourn there, still remain unopened
after all these ages, even by the present generation
of the Chinese, who conquered the country from the
colonists left in the empire by the Law-giver. These
solitary rocks were situated in plains surrounded by
corn-fields, similar to the situation and position of
the Pyramids of Egypt and Mexico. The traveller
says:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the course of the day we passed by one town
and three villages (proceeding towards Canton from
the south), likewise several remarkable rocks, nearly
perpendicular on all sides, and about two hundred
feet high, perfectly isolated, and unconnected with
any elevated ground whatsoever; besides, the circumjacent
country is low, level, alluvial soil, <em>well cultivated</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All these circumstances considered, it is rather
difficult to account for the existence of such a phenomenon
as these solitary rocks, so remote, too,
from any mountain, unless, perhaps, those prodigious
masses of solid stone have been, at some very remote
period of time, each the nucleus of a hill, in which
case they must have been below the surface of the
soil, which, being gradually washed down and carried
away by the floods, these rocks became denuded, and
left exposed in their present situation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Another conjecture may be offered on this subject,
that probably they have been placed, as now
seen, by the operation of the same causes that effected
the general deluge, when the globe suffered such
dreadful disruptions and convulsions as, according
to the Mosaic relation, to shake the very pillars of
the earth, and to break up the fountains of the great
deep; the truth of this will appear obvious when we
consider the nature of that powerful agent which
occasioned this memorable catastrophe.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c007'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The Pyramids of Mexico are termed by the learned
Dr. Robinson temples and mounds of earth; and
the Pyramids of Egypt have been mentioned by
Bruce and other travellers as natural rocks and
mounds. So that it is not extraordinary that a shipwrecked
seaman, travelling on foot along the coast of
China towards Canton, should call these unexplored
pyramids solitary rocks. There are such mounds or
rocks in Ireland. Now that country was visited in
ancient times by the Phenicians, who were originally a
colony of Egyptians, and who must have witnessed
the construction, or perhaps even assisted
in the building of the Pyramids of Egypt, by command
of Joseph, or Zaphnath-paaneah; they also
assisted King Solomon in building the Temple in
Jerusalem. These Phenicians, then, built pyramids
in Ireland, which, though a fertile island, has been
subject to frequent visitations of famine. The learned
traveller Kohl speaks of these erections, in his work
on Ireland, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Moate of Lisserdowling is a round conical
hill, about forty feet high, and almost five hundred
feet in circumference. It stands in a plain, and is
surrounded by <em>corn-fields</em>, and, being planted with
trees and white-thorn bushes, presents a stately
object on the naked level. On the summit the
Moate was flat, with an indentation in the middle,
leaving a few stones bare, that seemed to form part
of some masonry concealed under the turf, by which
the whole of the artificial hill was covered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The popular tradition, I was told, assigned the
moat as a dwelling-place to an ancient Irish chief of
the name of Naghten O’Donnell, and a small by-road
in the neighbourhood is still called, after him, Naghten’s
Lane. The hill stands in high repute throughout
the country, and is a favourite resort on fine
afternoons, when hundreds may be seen sitting and
lying on its sides; but not one of these visitors
remains after dark, when the Moate of Lisserdowling,
and the lane leading to it, are abandoned to the
fairies, or ‘good people,’ as they are called in Ireland.
Nor will anyone touch a stone or a stick on the hill,
‘unless they have had a dream,’ as my farmer
expressed himself, ‘and have had a commission from
the good people.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“I observed on the side of the mount the stump
of an old thorn-bush. My guide informed me that
the bush itself had been blown down one windy
night, many years ago, and had been left to rot on
the ground where it fell, no one daring to touch it,
though in general the poor people are ready enough
to appropriate to themselves anything burnable that
they may find by the wayside. Young trees they
will steal with very little remorse, but wood growing
on one of these fairy mounts is almost always secure
from their depredations.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On the following day I visited a similar hill, the
Moate-o’-Ward, which was likewise covered with
white thorns, and in the sequel I met with great
numbers of these artificial hillocks, of which Ireland
contains many more than England or Scotland. The
people call them moats, a word used in English
to designate the ditch of a fortress. In Irish they
are called ‘raths,’ a word bearing precisely the
same signification. They are also sometimes called
‘Dane’s Mounts’; for in Ireland, as every art of
destruction is charitably set down to Cromwell’s
account, so every erection of a remote date is
attributed to the Danes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The popular belief is quite unanimous, therefore,
in giving the Danes the credit of having erected these
tumuli, as fortresses whence they might hold the
country in subjection; and when the Danes had
been expelled, an Irish chief here and there chose
the deserted fastness for his dwelling-place. The
learned are not quite so unanimous in their views
as to the origin of these erections. Some go with the
stream, and set them down to Danish account; others
believe the hillocks to be of a much more ancient
date, and to have formed the strongholds of the
ancient native kings. In the north of Ireland is a
mound of enormous size, said to have been the seat
of the kings of Ulster.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Probably this earthy architecture, which appears
to have been so widely diffused over Ireland, was the
work of different ages, of various races, and had
more objects than one in view. Nearly all the nations
of Europe, in the infancy of their civilization, seem
to have delighted in the erection of these artificial
hills. The whole of Southern Russia is full of them,
and we meet with them in Hungary, Turkey, Scandinavia,
and Denmark, as well as in England and
Ireland; but nowhere in such numbers as in Ireland,
whence we may conclude that the ancient Irish must
have built many of their raths long before the Danes
arrived among them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is also probable that they were erected with
different objects in view. Some, we know, were
intended as boundary marks, and some, we know,
were raised over the remains of distinguished heroes
and chiefs. From some it was customary for the
law-givers and judges to announce their decisions
to the assembled multitude, and on others kings
were anointed and crowned. The Druids required
sacred hills to offer their sacrifices on, and where a
natural hill was not to be had an artificial one, no
doubt, was often formed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Others, again, may have been intended as
fortresses on which the people might seek refuge
from an enemy. Many, no doubt, remain that are
quite enigmatical. Several, when opened, are found
to contain passages and cells, of which it is difficult
to guess what use they were intended for. They are
too small for storehouses, and can scarcely have
served as tombs, or bones and other remains would
have been found there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lisserdowling, a high pyramid surrounded by
a low rampart and ditch, is more likely, in my
opinion, to have been erected as a religious monument
than as a fortress. Had it been intended for a
fortress, why should so much labour have been
expended in giving it a conical form, and why not
have bestowed more pains on the circumvallation.
As a fortress it would have been the strangest and
most ineligible that could have been built. The
space on the summit would scarcely afford room for
two huts, and when the ramparts had once been
stormed by the enemy, the defenders would have
been at the greatest disadvantage on the sides of
the cone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Probably the circumvallation has led to the
belief that this, and many other tumuli, were intended
for fortresses; but Stonehenge, which nobody
ever took to be a fortress, is also surrounded by rampart
and ditch. The circumvallation may have been
intended simply to mark the boundary of the holy
place, and to cut off all connection with the profane
part of the world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>These ruins which Mr. Kohl has described, and
respecting which he has given his opinion, are simply
the remains of ancient granaries or pyramids, erected
by the Phenicians, who left them standing when
they returned to their own country. After the
departure of these Phenicians, Ireland was visited by
the Moors, who were masters of Spain and Portugal.
These Moors coming from the coast of Africa, opposite
Spain, were a colony formerly from the heart of
Negroland, whence they reached the coast by way of
the great desert called the Sahara, and joined their
<a id='countrymen' name='countrymen' />countrymen who had already settled in the new
empire called <a id='mauritania' name='mauritania' />Mauritania, which comprised Morocco
and Tunis, &amp;c., of our time.</p>

<p class='c006'>These new visitors erected the round towers, in
which to stack corn, just as their predecessors had
constructed the Pyramids for a like purpose. There
are round granaries in Africa, constructed with
materials procurable in the place; but in Ireland
they used stone instead, which was more durable,
although retaining the same form as in the prototypes.
The following is what Kohl says about the round
towers:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“On leaving Kilrush I entrusted my person and my
portmanteau to a small boat which I had engaged to
carry me over to Scattery Island, and thence to the coast
of Kerry. The morning was warm, and not a breath
of wind disturbed the surface of the water, but the
sun was completely concealed by a thick yellow fog,
which scarcely allowed us to see beyond the length
of our boat. Nevertheless, my boatman brought
me in safety to the little green island, which I was
about to visit for the sake of its interesting ruins,
and by the time we reached its shore the fog had
sufficiently dispersed to allow us to distinguish the
remains of its ‘Seven Churches,’ while the lofty
column of the round towers presented itself at first
as a dark line, and then gradually broke with more
distinctness through the turbid atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c006'>“These Round Towers are the most interesting
remains of antiquity that Ireland possesses. Like
most travellers in Ireland, I was soon infected with a
passion for round towers; but as this passion is one
of which few of my friends in Germany are likely to
have a distinct idea, I believe that some introductory
remarks on these venerable buildings will not be
out of place here.</p>

<p class='c006'>“These Round Towers are built of large stones,
and when seen at a distance look rather like lofty
columns than towers, being from the base to
the top of nearly the same thickness. They are now,
indeed, by no means all of the same height, many
of them having fallen into ruins; but those which
remain tolerably complete are all from 100 to 120
feet high, from forty to fifty in circumference, and
from thirteen to sixteen in diameter. At the base
the wall is always very thick and strong, but becomes
slighter towards the top. Within, the tower is hollow,
without any opening but a door, generally eight or
ten feet from the ground, and some very narrow
apertures or windows, mostly four in number, near
the top.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c007'><sup>[74]</sup></a> These windows are usually turned towards
the four cardinal points of the compass.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In all parts of Ireland these singular buildings
are found scattered about, all resembling each other
like the obelisks of Egypt. Sometimes round towers
are found in solitary islands, sometimes on the side
of a river, or a plain, or some secluded corner of a
valley. The whole number of them, according to
the map of Ireland published by the Society for the
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, is, at present, 118;
of these fifteen are in a perfect state of preservation,
and of thirty-six little more than the foundation
remains.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The general name of ‘Round Towers’ is very
little characteristic of these remarkable buildings, for
towers are seldom otherwise than round. Some
writers have called them ‘pillar temples,’ but this
name assigns to them a designation which it is by no
means certain that they bore. The characteristic
peculiarity of these towers consists in their resemblance
to mighty pillars, and the most appropriate
name for them would, in my opinion, be ‘pillar
towers.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“In no part of Europe do we find any similar building
of antiquity. In Scotland, it is said, two or three
pillar towers exist, and these, it may be inferred,
were reared by Irish colonists. In the far east only
we come to erections of the same character and dimension;
the first thing that a traveller is reminded of
on seeing an Irish round tower, is a Turkish minaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No authentic records exist to guide us to a
knowledge of the time when these towers were built,
or of the use for which they were intended. Everything
proves that they have existed from a very
remote antiquity, and the most opposite conclusions
have been adopted with respect to the period and
object of their erection; none of these hypotheses
carry conviction with them, but of many, at least,
the absurdity can be shown with little trouble.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some, for instance, have maintained that these
towers were built by the Danes; but these sages
appear to have forgotten that round towers are found
in parts of the island where the Danes never set foot,
as, for instance, in Donegal and the remote counties
of Connaught. Besides, had these been Danish
erections, how came the Danes not to leave any of
them in England?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Popular tradition assigns them to the Phœnicians,
and learned antiquarians ought not too hastily
to reject popular tradition, for often the memory of
a people undergoes less corruption and change in the
course of a thousand years than do the records
preserved in books. There is nothing very improbable
in the hypothesis that these towers were built
by the Phœnicians, who are known to have visited
the island and to have exercised power there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Travellers have recently discovered in the
Persian province of Masanderan towers precisely
similar to those of Ireland, and in India erections
of a similar kind, dedicated to religious purposes,
have also been met with. This, taken in connection
with the shape of the Turkish minaret, makes it
extremely probable that the round towers have had
an Oriental origin. Many have been staggered by
the great antiquity which such an hypothesis would
assign to the Irish towers, but they are buildings of
wonderful solidity, and there is nothing at all extraordinary
in the supposition that these stones may
have remained in their present position for some
thousands of years. Have we not even brick buildings
of Roman erection, that are known to have been
built before the Christian era?</p>

<p class='c006'>“No less diversified have been the opinions
respecting the use for which the round towers
were intended, and on this subject some strangely
absurd doctrines have been advanced. Some people
have supposed them to have formed chains of telegraph
stations spread out over the whole island; but
the absurdity of this notion is sufficiently shown by
the position of some of the towers upon low ground,
in the corners of valleys, and on remote and solitary
islands, whence nothing could well be seen, and
nothing, therefore, made known. This opinion is,
nevertheless, still entertained by many.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Others suppose the towers to have been fortresses,
erected in the early ages of Christianity as
places of refuge, in case of danger, for the priests
and their church treasures. I can hardly think,
however, that any people could have selected such a
style of architecture for places of defence. The
defenders within would have had to stand upon each
other’s heads, and their only means of annoying their
enemies would have been the four small openings at
the top, eighty or a hundred feet from the ground.
Besides, had the round towers been military places
of defence, they would probably have all been
destroyed in the course of the constant wars by
which the island has been afflicted, whereas the
round towers have evidently been preserved by the
people with great care, and have ever been looked
on by them with the greatest veneration.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The notion that the round towers were built by
the early Christians as steeples to hang their bells in
is equally untenable, for, though they are frequently
found in close vicinity to the ruins of churches, yet
no kind of steeple could be worse constructed for
such a purpose, as the sound of the bells would
scarcely have been heard through the small apertures
at the top, except by those who had already assembled
around the tower.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Many other opinions have been hazarded, but all
at variance with the popular tradition, which represents
the round towers to have been the temples of
the old fire-worshippers from the East, who came
over with the Phœnicians. The poet Moore and
other Irish antiquarians are disposed to adopt this
tradition, the more so as the pyreas of the Ghebers,
according to the account of several travellers, bear
the closest similitude to the Irish towers, and
because the worship of fire is known to have been
at one time the prevailing religion of Ireland. The
dark interiors of these towers have been well calculated
to show the sacred fire preserved there to the
greatest advantage, and the height of the entrance-door
from the ground would be explained by the
sanctity of the place, to which only a few were
probably allowed to have access.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The great height of the towers has been objected
to as entirely superfluous, supposing them to have been
applied to such a use; but it may have been customary
to place the sacred fire in an elevated position,
as an additional mark of respect, and then the towers
may have answered more purposes than one; from
the windows at the top signals may have been made
to summon the faithful to prayer, or the apertures
may have been used for astronomical observations,
intended to fix the time of the religious feasts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Christian emblems have been discovered in some
of these towers. On the summit of that near Swords,
in the county of Dublin, is a small stone cross, and
in others even representations of the Virgin have
been found; but these, there cannot be a doubt, are
of modern addition. That churches and cemeteries
should so often be found in the vicinity of these
towers is nothing surprising, for a building that has
once become sacred in the eyes of a people, generally
retains a portion of its sanctity, even though the
original religion may be utterly swept away. Most
of the early Christian churches were erected on the
foundations of heathen temples, and a large portion
of the Turkish mosques were formerly Christian
churches.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Generally, where in the vicinity of a round
tower there occur the ruins of churches, these are
in number seven. This has been explained by supposing
that, previously to the appearance of St.
Patrick, Christianity—but not Roman Catholic
Christianity—had been introduced into Ireland.
This ante-patrician Christianity is said to have
been introduced by the Apostle James, who first
preached the gospel in Ireland, and established the
Eastern Church there, with the rites of the Eastern
Œcumenic Synods; and the frequent appearance of
seven churches close to each other is accounted for
as a reference to the seven celebrated churches of
the East.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In this hypothesis, though stoutly denied by the
Roman Catholics, there is nothing improbable, and,
if true, it affords another remarkable proof of the
early connection between Ireland and the East. In
no other Christian land in Europe do we constantly
find the ruins of ancient churches in groups of
seven.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We effected a landing on Scattery Island, called
in ancient times Inniscattery, and at present occupied
by a few tenants of a Mr. M’Kean, who graze
their cattle there. ‘It is a very old ancient place,’
said one of the boatmen, as he was carrying me
through the water on his shoulders, for we had come
to a landing-place where the tide had left one foot
of water over a large extent of coast. This pleonasm
of ‘old ancient’ might be applied to many parts of
Ireland, where old and older ruins are constantly
found in close contiguity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In general, where there are seven churches, in
Ireland, some ancient saint is named as having lived
and died there, and as having belonged to the first
preachers of Christianity in the country. At Scattery
it is Saint Senanus, whose grave is still shown amid
one of the ruins, and whose fame has been extended
far beyond his native isle by one of Moore’s melodies.
These ancient ruins, however, have many
graves of a more modern date; for bodies are still
brought over from the mainland to be interred at
Scattery. On the occasion of such a funeral, one
boat serves generally as a hearse, and the mourners
follow in other boats.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I saw many tomb-stones only a few years old,
with new inscriptions, from which the gilding had
scarcely begun to fade, and their effect upon the
solitary and remote island was peculiar and by no
means unpleasing. Among them were the tombs of
several captains of ships, and it would have been
difficult to suggest a more appropriate place of
interment for such men than this little island
cemetery at the mouth of a great river, with the
wide ocean rolling in front. Indeed, there is no
other country in Europe where there are such interesting
cemeteries, or such picturesque tombs, as in
Ireland, partly on account of the abundance of ivy
with which they are hung, and partly on account of
the practice that still prevails of burying the dead
among ruins.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of some of the seven churches on Scattery isle,
scarcely a trace remained; but three of them were
in tolerable preservation. Their walls, covered with
ivy, remained, and into the wall of one of them, that
nearest the round tower, a stone strangely sculptured
into the form of a human face had been introduced.
Strange to say, it has completely the stiff, mask-like
features and projecting ears of the Egyptian statue,
whence I conclude it must have belonged originally
to some other building. On the opposite wall is a
stone with evident traces of an ancient inscription.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The round tower stands a little to the side.
Although not perfect, it belongs to the most picturesque
in Ireland, for it has been struck by lightning,
and has received a split on one side from top to
bottom. On the south side it is covered completely
with mosses and creeping plants; on the north and
west side it is bare, the heavy winds, as the sailors
told me, making all vegetation impossible there.
Lightning and vegetation are the worst enemies the
round towers have to contend with, and it is strange
that such active foes should not have been able to
overturn the whole of them in a space of two
thousand years.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All the land upon the little island, except the
cemetery, is pasturage. A small battery has been
erected here to protect the mouth of the Shannon,
the entrance to which river is defended by no less
than six batteries and forts, while at the mouth of
the Thames there is not one.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On leaving Inniscattery, to repair to the kingdom
of Kerry, we had work enough before us, for
the tide was against us, besides which we had to
contend with such a variety of currents, that the
boatmen required all their skill and experience to
carry their slight skiff in safety to the little port of
Tarbert, whither we were bound. The mouth of the
Shannon has rather the character of an arm of the
sea, but to consider it as such would be in violation
of the principles of Irish geography.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The waves, now of a very respectable size,
were rolling out towards the ocean; but the fog
was completely gone, and we had the most beautiful
sunshine. With the exception of our own
little bark, which seemed to crest the waves like
a bird, neither ship nor boat was to be seen upon
the noble estuary, and, without passing a human
creature with whom we could have exchanged a
salutation, we arrived at length in safety at our
destined harbour.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There I learned, when it was too late, that
without any additional expenditure of time or
trouble, I might have effected a landing at Ballybunian,
whose marine caverns, at the mouth of the
Shannon, are reckoned among the wonders of
Ireland. These caverns stretch more than a mile
from the sea into the land. Ireland, indeed, is
rich in remarkable caverns, many of which are but
little known to the scientific world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The original models from which the Round Towers
of Ireland were taken are still to be found in the
Soudan of Africa; and the people whose ancestors
erected buildings after this fashion, as they migrated
from their native country to the seaboard, and crossed
over to Spain—whence they visited Ireland—are to
this day as savage in manners and customs as their
forefathers were before they left Africa. The following
description of the round conical granaries, the
country where they are situated, and the builders of
them, is taken from a work called <cite>Egypt, the Soudan,
and Central Africa</cite>, by John Petherick, F.R.G.S.,
Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for the Soudan:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Those of my men who had wintered with the
Djour had procured from the negroes a large
quantity of tusks, the accumulation of several years’
hunting. Their journeys had extended to the confines
of the Rohl, in the east, and in the territory of
the Djour westwards beyond the large stream which,
on reference to the map, will be seen as the largest
feeder of the lake. I had discovered southwards they
had penetrated the Dôr territory; and as they had
succeeded in gaining the good-will of the Dôr
chief Djau, I despatched a party to invite him to
meet me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The porters who had accompanied me from the
Raik, on learning my intention to proceed south
amongst tribes unknown to them, and dreaded in
consequence of the difference of weapons and savage
habits, refused to proceed; and, consigning loads of
ivory to them, in charge of a detachment of my
Khartoumers, I sent them back to their own
country. Levying in their stead a party of Djour
for the transport of my stock in trade, I took the
advantage of a moonlight night to perform the
journey to the Dôr to Fan-Djau (the country of
Djau), so named after my chief Djau, situated in
about six degrees north latitude.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our reception amongst them was most hospitable,
and in the vicinity of the chief’s huts we
were accommodated with strong wooden sheds, about
six feet high, upon which their corn, divested of its
reeds, was prettily stacked, consisting of different
kinds of dourra of different colours—white, grey, and
red—in separate batches. The stacks were formed
with much taste, the sides being perpendicular,
terminating in a cone. The precaution of raising
their stacks so high from the ground was to preserve
it from vermin and the white ants.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Dôr surpass the Djour in industry, a proof
of which existed in their extensive fields and granaries.
Prior to the rainy season, their grain was
threshed and preserved in large cylindrical receptacles,
constructed of reeds and clay, from twelve to
fifteen feet in diameter, and four feet in height, supported
upon a strong wood framework some four feet
from the ground. To preserve its contents from the
rain, it was covered by a large thatched framework,
not unlike an extinguisher in shape, and was so light
in substance, that when the grain was required, one
side of it could be lifted and supported by a pole,
and the granary entered.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c007'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“Their huts were constructed of a beautiful
basket-work of cane. The perpendicular walls were
six feet high, and were surmounted with a pretty
cupola-shaped reed roof, topped with wood carvings
of birds. A wooden bedstead occupied its centre,
and an oval-shaped hole, two and a half feet high,
barely sufficient to admit a man in a stooping posture,
formed the doorway. At night this was
barricaded with logs of wood laid horizontally upon
each other, between perpendicular posts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cooking was carried on in a separate hut, and
in lieu of the stone-mill in use in the Soudan, a
large wooden mortar, the pestle some four or five
feet in length, by three inches diameter, served as
their flour-mill. Their food consisted principally of
a thick porridge, and a sauce flavoured with herbs
and red pepper; but beef, whenever they could
obtain it by barter for grain with the Djour, or
meat from the chase, was preferred. Rats, mice,
and snakes were highly esteemed, and of these the
children were continually in search. Fowls were
reared to a great extent, but from some unaccountable
superstition they were only considered proper
food for women: if eaten by men, it was a proof of
effeminacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Dôr territories are more considerable than
any I had yet traversed; and their language, the
nouns of which generally terminated in <i>o</i> or <i>a</i>, was
entirely different from any that I had heard. The
men were shorter in stature than the tall Dinka
Shillooks, but broader in the chest and stouter-limbed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Total nudity was held in contempt by them,
although their covering was reduced to the smallest
possible amount; and when the Djour entered their
village, the little hide ornament worn by them in
common with the Dinka tribes, as a mark of respect
was turned round to the front.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of a dark brown colour, they further differed
from the negroes hitherto described, in the preservation
of their teeth and the difference of their
weapons: these consisted of bows and arrows,
fearfully-barbed lances, and a variety of clubs. Some
resembled the mace of the Middle Ages, whilst
others, made of hard wood, were like the mushroom.
The edges were firm and sharp, and when employed
against an enemy would cleave the skull. The
points of their arrows, made of iron, are also numerously
barbed; the workmanship, in a variety of
patterns, is admirable.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Dôr perhaps excel the Djour in smithery;
and, possessing no cattle, their valuables consist in
objects of iron, mostly in circular plates from nine
inches to one foot in diameter, and long ornamented
lance-like articles. For a certain number of these
they intermarry.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Goats and fowls are their only domestic animals;
the former a short-legged and smooth-haired variety.
The coat is fine, and coloured frequently with large
round spots of black, yellow, or brown upon white:
they are not milked, although, when taken to Khartoum
and crossed with the native race, they become
excellent milkers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The women would be handsome were it not for a
disfiguration of the under lip, in which circular
pieces of wood are inserted, varying in size, according
to age, from a sixpence to a florin. The young women
are naked, but the married women wear large clusters
of green leaves in front and behind, which, attached
by a belt to the waist, reach to the ankles. Clean in
their habits, they are particular in the daily renewal
of their costume from the bush, the numerous evergreens
and creeping plants affording them an abundant
material for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Their ears, necks, and waists are profusely
adorned with beads, and on their wrists they wear
numerous iron bracelets. The ankles are encumbered
with bright heavy iron rings, fully one inch thick;
and these tinkling together as they dance produce a
peculiarly fascinating sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the centre of the village is a large circus,
where, on a tree, their war-trophies, the skulls of the
slain, are suspended. Beneath it large tom-toms,
made of hollowed trunks of trees, well finished, and
strung with dressed buffalo-hides, were used only on
occasions of universal rejoicing, or to sound the alarm
in time of war. The sound could be heard miles
distant. At ordinary times smaller instruments of
the same kind were employed. This large circus was
carefully swept and watered; and under the shade of
the tree the men met during the day, and in the
evenings, more especially on moonlight nights, it was
the scene of great conviviality.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The several approaches to it were narrow foot-paths,
and both sides were ornamented with rough
wooden posts, carved into semblances of human
figures, four feet apart; the first were largest in size,
the others had on their heads wooden bowls. These
figures were said to represent the chief proceeding to
a festival, and followed by his retainers bearing
viands and <i>mau</i> to the feast.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The village was prettily situated at the foot of a
hill, around which were two or three other villages,
this forming the entire community of a large district.
From its summit a beautiful view of the surrounding
country was obtained. Surrounding the village, at a
moderate distance, were the unfenced gardens of the
villagers, in which cucurbits, vegetables, and seeds
were grown; and beyond, to the eastward, was a large
plain of cultivated dourra fields; southward, at about
one mile distant, a winding brook was to be seen,
bordered with superb trees and flourishing canes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The bush supplied a variety of game, consisting
of partridges, guinea-fowl, a large white boar, gazelles,
antelopes, and giraffes. Elephants and buffalo I did
not encounter, and I was told they only frequented
the locality during the rainy season.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Dôr acknowledge no superior chief, and the
tribe is divided into separate communities; and these,
although living, as in this instance, in close proximity,
look upon each other as almost separate tribes, holding
little or no communication. They live in a state of
continual feud, attributable to encroachments on
hunting-grounds. Their battues consist in driving
the game into strong nets, which, suspended to the
trunks of trees at right angles, cover a space of
several miles.</p>

<p class='c006'>“During my stay at Djau, a hunt of this description,
in which the inhabitants of a village some miles
distant joined, took place, and, as usual, ended in a
quarrel. Sitting under my habitation at noon, several
boys returned to the village for extra weapons for
the use of their fathers. The alarm spread instantly
that a fight was taking place, and the women <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>
proceeded to the scene with yellings and shrieks indescribable.
Seizing my rifle, and accompanied by
four of my followers, curiosity to see a negro fight
tempted me to accompany them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After a stiff march of a couple of hours through
bush and glade, covered with waving grass reaching
nearly to our waists, the return of several boys
warned us of the proximity of the fight, and of their
fear of its turning against them—the opposing party
being the most numerous. Many of the women
hurried back to their homes, to prepare, in case of
emergency, for flight and safety in the bush. For
such an occurrence, to a certain extent, they are
always prepared; several parcels of grain, and provisions
neatly packed up in spherical forms, in leaves
surrounded by network, being generally kept ready
in every hut for a sudden start.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Accelerating our pace, and climbing up a steep
hill, as we reached the summit and were proceeding
down a gentle slope, I came in contact with Djau
and his party in full retreat, and leaping like greyhounds
over the low underwood and high grass. On
perceiving me they halted, and rent the air with
shouts of ‘The white chief! the white chief!’ and I
was almost suffocated by the embraces of the chief.
My presence gave them courage to face the enemy
again; a loud peculiar shrill whoop from the grey-headed
but still robust chief was the signal for attack,
and, bounding forward, they were soon out of sight.
To keep up with them would have been an impossibility;
but, marching at the top of our pace, we
followed them as best we could.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After a long march down a gentle declivity, at
the bottom of which was a beautiful glade, we again
came up with them, drawn up in line in pairs, some
yards apart from each other, within the confines of
the bush, not a sound indicating their presence.
Joining them, and inquiring what had become of the
enemy, the men whom I addressed silently pointed to
the bush on the opposite side of the glade, some
three hundred yards across.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Notwithstanding my intention of being a mere
spectator, I now felt myself compromised in the
fight; and although unwilling to shed blood, I could
not resist my aid to the friends who afforded me an
asylum amongst them. Marching accordingly into
the open with my force of four men, I resolved that
we would act as skirmishers on the side of our hosts,
who retained their position in the bush.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We had proceeded about a third of the way
across the glade, when the enemy advanced out of
the wood and formed a long line of two or three
deep, on its confines opposite to us. I also drew up
my force, and for an instant we stood looking at each
other. Although within range, at about two hundred
yards’ distance, I did not like to fire upon them;
but in preference continued advancing, thinking the
prestige of my fire-arms would be sufficient. I was
right. We had scarcely marched fifty yards, when a
general flight took place, and in an instant Djau and
his host, amounting to some three or four hundred
men, passed us in hot pursuit.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After reflection on the rashness of exposing myself
with so few men to the hostility of some six hundred
negroes, and in self-congratulation on the effect my
appearance in the fight had produced, I awaited the
return of my hosts. In the course of an hour this
took place; and as they advanced I shall never forget
the impression they made upon me. A more
complete picture of savage life I could not have imagined.
A large host of naked negroes came trooping
on, grasping in their hands bow and arrow, lances
and clubs, with wild gesticulations and frightful yells
proclaiming their victory, whilst one displayed the
reeking head of a victim.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I refused to join them in following up the defeat
of their enemies by a descent on their villages. With
some difficulty they were persuaded to be content
with the success already achieved—that of having
beaten off a numerically superior force—and return
to their homes. Their compliance was only obtained
by an actual refusal of further co-operation; but in
the event of a renewed attack upon their villages, the
probability of which was suggested, I promised them
my willing support.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We had not gone fifty paces, when I beheld the
form of a young man prostrate, apparently lifeless;
and seeing only a deep incision across his wrist,
nearly severing the hand from the arm, and a lance-thrust
that had penetrated the shoulder between the
muscle and the flesh, his open eyes suggested that
life might not be extinct. I felt his pulse, but it was
imperceptible. At the same time a negro with his
lance coolly severed the muscle, and extricated the
barbed projectile. I looked upon the man with disgust;
but, with a laugh, taking the body by the
hand, he rolled it over on the chest, and then two
open lance-wounds between the shoulders plainly
showed the cause of death.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On our way home the body was drawn by the
legs for a considerable distance, and finally carried
on the shoulders of some of the party to conceal the
trail. It was secreted in the bush in the hope of its
eluding the search of the enemy, leaving it to be
devoured by beasts of prey; but the head, severed
from the body, was secured and destined, with four
others, to be suspended on the tree in the centre of
the village circus.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At night great rejoicings took place, commencing
with a war-dance by the women, who, in pairs,
closely following each other to the sound of the tom-tom,
and chanting a war-song, moved in measured
steps round the tree. At each time, as the procession
approached the heads of the victims, a halt took place,
and insulting epithets addressed to the fallen were
followed by the clanking of their anklets and shrieks
of applause. Sickened with the exhibition, I retired
from the scene.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The day following, after a night’s conviviality,
the heads were secreted in the bush in order to
bleach the skulls. Another feast celebrated their
suspension on the tree.”</p>

<p class='c006'>These are the descendants of the Moors who built
the Round Towers in Ireland, when they became
masters of Spain!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER X.</span><br /> <br />DEATH OF MOSES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Law-giver, when he had firmly established the
two extensive empires of Mexico and Peru, had it in
his mind to found another kingdom in the north of
Mexico, which should include King George’s Sound,
in the Pacific Ocean, and stretch across the continent
of North America till it reached the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p class='c006'>This immense tract of country was inhabited by
savages, living like the wild animals by whom they
were surrounded. They knew not God, nor had
they any idea of religion, having no greater intelligence
than that possessed by the brute creation. It
was, however, the intention of Moses to visit these
people, to teach them the knowledge of civilised life,
and to impart to them the blessings of religion and
industry.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, indeed, was the mission on which Moses was
sent over the different quarters of the habitable globe
by his God, who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and
who took him away from the camp of the children of
Israel at the ford of the river Jordan, viz. that he
(Moses) might carry the glorious tidings of salvation
to nations that were living in ignorance and superstition.
He obeyed the sacred behest, and there are
ample proofs which attest the success of his mission
and labour of love.</p>

<p class='c006'>The route he took is marked by signs of flourishing
empires, with religion, learning, and laws, as far as
the spot where the servant of God was killed by
savages—the very people whom he came to reclaim.
He visited the coast of North America in a boat made
of copper, everything on board of which was made of
that metal. Of this the Indians are passionately
fond, and for the sake of it they killed the inspired
missionary.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the sequel proves that they repented of their
wicked deed—when it was too late. In the hope of
obtaining forgiveness from the murdered old man,
they paid him divine worship, and carved an image to
represent the visitant whom they so cruelly deprived
of life. The memory of this remarkable event was
handed down to posterity from generation to generation,
even to the time when Captain Meares visited
that coast in his ship; and the story was related to him
by one of the descendants of those who committed
the horrid crime. Captain Meares gives the following
narrative of what he heard:—<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c007'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“For a long time the English thought the inhabitants
had no religious belief whatever. To the huge
mis-shapen images seen in their houses they addressed
no homage; they had neither priests nor temples, nor
did they offer any sacrifices; but an accidental circumstance
led to the discovery that, though devoid
of all superstitious observances, and wholly ignorant
of the true God, they were not without a certain
species of mythology, including a belief of an existence
after death. This discovery arose from our
inquiries on a very different subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On expressing our wish to be informed by what
means they became acquainted with copper, and why
it was such a peculiar object of their admiration, a
son of Hannapa, one of the Nootkan chiefs, a youth
of uncommon sagacity, informed us of all he knew
on the subject; and we found, to our surprise, that
his story involved a little sketch of their religion.
When words were wanting he supplied the deficiency
by those expressive actions which nature or necessity
seems to communicate to people whose language is
imperfect; and the young Nootkan conveyed his
ideas by signs so skilfully as to render them perfectly
intelligible. He related his story in the following
manner:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“He first placed a certain number of sticks on
the ground, at small distances from each other, to
which he gave separate names. Thus, he called the
first his father, and the next his grandfather: he
then took what remained and threw them all into confusion
together, as much as to say that they were the
general heap of his ancestors, whom he could not
individually reckon.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He then, pointing to this bundle, said, when
they lived an old man entered the sound<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c007'><sup>[77]</sup></a> in a copper
canoe, with copper paddles, and everything else in his
possession of the same metal; that he paddled along
the shore, on which all the people were assembled to
contemplate so strange a sight, and that, having
thrown one of his copper paddles on shore, he himself
landed. The extraordinary stranger then told the
natives that he came from the sky, to which the boy
pointed with his hand; that their country would one
day be destroyed, when they would all be killed, and
rise again to live in the place from whence he came.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our young interpreter explained this circumstance
of his narrative by lying down as if he were
dead, and then, rising up suddenly, he imitated the
action as if he were soaring through the air. He
continued to inform us that the people killed the old
man, and took his canoe, from which event they
derived their fondness for copper; and he added that
the images in their houses were intended to represent
the form, and perpetuate the mission, of this supernatural
person who came from the sky.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus ended the glorious life of the man of God.
His death was as mysterious to his followers in
America, as was his disappearance and supposed death
to the Israelites in Asia. He was the first missionary
who carried the glad tidings of God’s good-will towards
an erring world; and he died the death of a
martyr at the hands of the very world that he came
to enlighten.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the time of his death Moses must have been
very old, for he was already one hundred and twenty
years old when he left the Israelites. To arrive at
the exact age to which he attained, an acquaintance
with the chronicles of many kingdoms would be
necessary, in order to know the date at which he
arrived, and what length of time he sojourned, in
each. But as most of the empires which Moses
founded are now under the government of various
nations, who have wantonly destroyed every vestige
of the history and traditions of their former kings,
this knowledge cannot be attained in this age of the
world.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Moses commenced his missionary life he was
accompanied by his Ethiopian consort,<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c007'><sup>[78]</sup></a> and a son, by
her, as there is evidence to prove in the painting at
Thebes, where there is a representation of the Ethiopian
princess with a boy on her lap.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c007'><sup>[79]</sup></a> There also
went with him Zipporah and her two sons, Gershom
and Eliezer,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c007'><sup>[80]</sup></a> and their sons,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c007'><sup>[81]</sup></a> and a large company
of Jews, Egyptians, and Ethiopians.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c007'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The doctrine that Moses preached everywhere was
the same as that he wrote and left among the Jews.
It will, therefore, not be out of place to rehearse it
here, as he rehearsed it before the Israelites previous
to his departure from their midst:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and
hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. My doctrine
shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the
dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as
the showers upon the grass: Because I will publish
the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto
our God. He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all
his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without
iniquity, just and right is he.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not
the spot of his children. Do ye thus requite the
Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy
father that hath bought thee? hath he not made
thee, and established thee?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Remember the days of old, consider the years of
many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew
thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee. When the
Most High divided to the nations the inheritance,
when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the
bounds of the people according to the number of the
children of Israel. For the Lord’s portion is his
people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. He
found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he
kept him as the apple of his eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over
her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,
beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did
lead him, and there was no strange god with him.
He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
that he might eat the increase of the fields, and he
made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out
of the flinty rock; butter of kine, and milk of sheep,
with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan,
and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and
thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art
waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered
with fatness; then he forsook God which made him,
and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. They
provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
abominations provoked they him to anger. They
sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom
they knew not, to new gods that came newly up,
whom your fathers feared not. Of the Rock that
begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten
God that formed thee.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them,
because of the provoking of his sons, and of his
daughters. And he said, I will hide my face from
them, I will see what their end shall be: for they
are a very froward generation, children in whom is
no faith. They have moved me to jealousy with
that which is not God; they have provoked me to
anger with their vanities: and I will move them to
jealousy with those which are not a people; I will
provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. For a
fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto
the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with
her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the
mountains.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend
mine arrows upon them. They shall be burnt with
hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with
bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of
beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the
dust. The sword without, and terror within, shall
destroy both the young man and the virgin, the
suckling also with the man of gray hairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I said, I would scatter them into corners, I
would make the remembrance of them to cease from
among men: Were it not that I feared the wrath of
the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave
themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our
hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.
For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there
any understanding in them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“O that they were wise, that they understood
this, that they would consider their latter end! How
should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand
to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and
the Lord had shut them up? For their Rock is not
as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being
judges. For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and
of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of
gall, their clusters are bitter. Their wine is the
poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps. Is
not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up
among my treasures?</p>

<p class='c006'>“To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence;
their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of
their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall
come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall
judge his people, and repent himself for his servants,
when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is
none shut up or left. And he shall say, Where are
their gods, their rock in whom they trusted, which
did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help
you, and be your protection.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no
god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound,
and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out
of my hand. For I lift up my hand to heaven, and
say I live for ever. If I whet my glittering sword,
and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render
vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them
that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk
with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh: and
that with the blood of the slain and of the captives,
from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he
will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render
vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful
unto his land, and to his people.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And Moses came and spake all the words of this
song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the
son of Nun. And Moses made an end of speaking
all these words to all Israel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto
all the words which I testify among you this day,
which ye shall command your children to observe to
do, all the words of this law. For it is not a vain
thing for you; because it is your life: and through
this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land,
whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c007'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER XI.</span><br /> <br />RECORD OF FAMINES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It appears from the numerous ruins of Pyramids
(and Round Towers), that the ancients, such as
Zaphnath-paaneah and Moses—the latter under a
great many different names—in their wisdom and
forethought erected them as granaries, so that, notwithstanding
the various causes of famine, their
territories might be always well provisioned and
able to withstand the attack of the dire enemy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Famine Statistics of modern times show how
necessary those precautions were. If the Round
Towers of Ireland had still been used in the
Christian Era as granaries, and well stored with
corn, instead of being turned into towers for hanging
church bells in, how many precious lives would have
been saved during all those famines which devastated
that beautiful island!</p>

           “While, however, the agriculturists of the continent were
           suffering from an abundance, a grievous famine arose in
           Ireland, showing the anomalies of her situation,
           resulting either from the staple food of her population
           differing from that of surrounding  nations, or the
           limitation of her commercial exchanges with her
           neighbours. Her distresses from scarcity were aggravated
           by the agrarian outrages, originating in the pressure of
           tythes and rack-rents on the peasantry and small farmers.
           Several of the ringleaders of these disorders were
           apprehended by the civil and military power, and great
           numbers executed or transported.”—Wade’s <cite>Brit. Hist.</cite></td>

<p class='c006'>The above table shows how terribly the Irish
people have suffered from want of food, and how in
their hunger they have been compelled to have
recourse to cannibalism in order to save themselves
from death by starvation. This sad picture should
be a lesson to fanatics like those who, in their misdirected
zeal to serve their Master in heaven,
destroyed the granaries of the ancient people, mistaking
them to be temples dedicated to heathen gods.
For, had the pyramids, which appear to have existed
in large numbers all over Ireland, been filled during
the years of plenty, and the grain kept in reserve
until the time of scarcity, there would then have
been sufficient food not only for the inhabitants of
Ireland, but also for the wants of the sister islands.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following chronological table of the famines
that have devastated England, Scotland and Wales,
is taken from Walford’s <cite>Famines of the World</cite>. It
presents a sad picture of human misery and wretchedness,
which might have been prevented by wisdom
and forethought.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this list of heart-rending desolation caused by
famine, may be added many other cases which have
occurred more recently, and among them the appalling
famine in China—a kingdom well provided with
granaries constructed by the ancient founder, Moses.
From the account given by a traveller, who marvelled
at such solitary hills standing in plains surrounded
by fertile corn-fields, it may safely be
inferred that these Pyramids or Storehouses still
remain unopened, and, consequently, are stored with
the produce of the fields that surround them. So
that had the Emperors of China been aware of the
existence of such treasure-houses in their extensive
dominions, peopled by innumerable millions of human
beings, they would never have had the sorrow of
reading such a harrowing account of misery suffered
by their subjects, arising from want of food, which
was so near at hand! This severe famine visited
China in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1877-78, and is thus chronicled by
Walford:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“North China.—A telegram dated 26th January
1878, says: ‘Appalling famine raging throughout
four provinces North China. Nine million people
reported destitute. Children daily sold in markets
for (raising means to procure) food. Foreign Relief
Committee appeal to England and America for assistance.’
Total population of districts affected, seventy
millions. Mr. Fredk. H. Balfour, of Shanghai,
said: ‘The people’s faces are black with hunger;
they are dying by thousands upon thousands. Women
and girls and boys are openly offered for sale to any
chance wayfarer. When I left the country, a respectable
married woman could be easily bought for six
dollars, and a little girl for two. In cases, however,
where it was found impossible to dispose of their
children, parents have been known to kill them
sooner than witness their prolonged sufferings, in
many instances throwing themselves afterwards down
wells, or committing suicide by arsenic.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Lord Derby received a report drawn up by
Mr. Mayers, Chinese Secretary of the Legation at
Pekin, upon the distress which the drought of the
last two years has caused in the northern and central
provinces of China. This famine, it seems, has been
most severely felt in the district furthest from the
coast. With the exception of Chefoo, and, in a
lesser degree, Tien-tsin, no foreign settlement has
come directly into contact with the misery which
has been described as existing in the interior, nor
are any immediate traces of it visible in the neighbourhood
of the capital. The apparent cause was
disturbance in the usually unfailing regularity of the
summer monsoons. The spring and summer of 1876
were marked in the southern maritime provinces,
Kwangtung and Fuhkien, and in a less degree also
along the coast as far north as Ningpo, by an excessive
rain-fall, causing in the two provinces above-named
disastrous floods and much destruction of
crops. In the north, on the contrary, from the
Yangtsze to the neighbourhood of Pekin and thence
eastward to the borders of Corea, an unusual drought
was experienced.’—<cite>Times</cite>, 13th March 1878.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Further papers on this famine were presented to
Parliament, 2nd July 1878. The number of souls
for whom relief is required is said to be between
three and four millions. One point brought out is the
enormous cost of transporting supplies to the province
of Shansi, where a mountain range has to be
crossed and a distance of some hundreds of miles to
be traversed by carts. Mr. Mayers says the reported
cost of transporting these supplies to Shansi would
be about four taels per picul, or, say, £12 sterling
per ton. Mr. Hugh Fraser sends from Pekin, 18th
January, the translation of a memorial addressed to
the throne by Yen King-Ming, ‘Special High Commissioner
for the Superintendence of the Arrangements
for Famine Relief in Shansi. The commissioner
dwells upon the painful scenes he has
witnessed at every stage of his journey, in the
course of which his chair has continually been
surrounded by crowds of the famine-stricken population
imploring relief, to whom he has administered
comfort in soothing words, assuring them of the
Imperial sympathy. The roads are lined with
corpses in such numbers as to distance all efforts
for their interment, while women and children,
starving and in rags, know not where to look for
the means of keeping body and soul together. The
memorialist, his heart wrung with despairing pity,
cannot but ask, why has a calamity so awful as this
been visited upon the people. He can only ascribe
it to his own failure in the due discharge of his duty,
and he feels that his short-coming admits of no
excuse. In reply, the Grand Council has received a
rescript expressing profound sympathy with the sufferings
of the people as reported in this memorial,
and directing that all that is possible for their relief
be done, in consultation with the governor of the
province.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Note.—The Empire of China has long been subject
to the most serious famines; but of these we
have found no details available.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is sad to know that famines will occur, as long
as man exists on the earth at enmity with his
Creator. The ground was cursed on man’s account,
and therefore it is man’s duty to appease the anger
of his offended God. As man was taught by the
Lord God to plough, and to sow, to reap and to
garner up for the winter; so is it incumbent on
those who govern nations to exercise their benevolence
and make provision of food in granaries and
storehouses against the recurrence of famines.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the olden times, there were constructed near
corn-fields, in all the countries over which the
descendants of Israel ruled, most noble, solid granaries
in rocks, as well as aqueducts and canals
throughout their dominions. In the present age
not a single civilized nation is prepared for a calamity
which is sure to visit every country under heaven,
sooner or later.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all countries, India is the one where famines
recur most frequently, as the following table attests.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Famines in India have arisen from several different
causes; but the most general cause has not
been failure of the usual rains. Distress has also,
however, been caused by hostile invasions; by
swarms of rats and locusts; by storms and floods;
and not unfrequently by the immigration of the
starving people from distant distressed parts into
districts otherwise well provided with food supplies;
and occasionally by excessive exports of grain into
famine-stricken districts; or by combinations of two
or more of the above-named circumstances.”—Report
1878, p. 2, Mr. F. C. Danvers.</p>

<p class='c006'>These stern facts prove that, in times of plenty,
grain should be garnered in each district, and held in
reserve till the time of famine, when, food being
found at hand, the people would have no need to
migrate into neighbouring provinces. The finest
example set for the imitation of those who have the
destiny of nations in their hands, is that precaution
adopted by Joseph, when he expected the visitation
of the seven years’ famine.</p>

<p class='c006'>This memorable famine took place in the year <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
1708. But the land of Egypt had corn in her
granaries—the Pyramids of our time; therefore none
of the Egyptians died from starvation. Egypt even
supplied food to other famine-stricken countries; for
the Bible says, “the famine was over all the face of
the earth; and all countries came into Egypt to
Joseph for to buy corn, because that the famine was
so sore in all lands.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1064 there was another seven
years’ famine in Egypt, but the land was governed
by a people ignorant of what the Pyramids were, and
how their contents had once saved the world from a
cruel death. The following account shows the consequences
of their ignorance:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Egypt.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c007'><sup>[86]</sup></a> For seven successive years the overflow
of the Nile failed, and with it almost the entire subsistence
of the country; while the rebels interrupted
supplies of grain from the north. Two provinces were
entirely depopulated; in another half the inhabitants
perished; while in Cairo city (El-Káhireh) the people
were reduced to the direst straits. Bread was sold
for 14 dirhems to the loaf; and all provisions being
exhausted, the worst horrors of famine followed.
The wretched resorted to cannibalism, and organised
bands kidnapped the unwary passenger in the desolate
streets, principally by means of ropes furnished
with hooks and let down from the latticed windows.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the year 1072 the famine reached its height.
It was followed by a pestilence, and this again was
succeeded by an invading army.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And again in “1877, short rainfall and low Nile;
great scarcity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>These calamities have occurred hitherto, and so
long as the world exists they will occur again. It
therefore behoves all monarchs and governors to
adopt measures similar to those employed by Joseph,
the first Viceroy of Egypt; that, wherever and
whenever the enemy may appear, every nation may
be found so well provided against it as to escape its
dire consequences.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER XII.</span><br /> <br />APOTHEOSIS OF MOSES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the period when the Shepherd Kings ruled
the land of Egypt famine was not allowed to depopulate
the world. After these Kings came their
descendant Moses, the mortal to whom the Almighty
spoke from the top of Mount Sinai, in the presence
of a multitude of witnesses, and gave laws by which
man must defend himself from an enemy more cruel
than famine; for those who die from famine may still
rise to enjoy life eternal, whereas death brought into
the world by sin, through the instigation of Satan, is
death eternal, from which there is no resurrection.</p>

<p class='c006'>This inspired Moses taught the Israelites how to
serve God, the only way by which they can secure
themselves from eternal death. And when he considered
them capable of continuing in the way he set
them, he went to other nations, and everywhere
instructed the people, that they might live for ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the moral precepts he taught in the Far
East, in Hindustan, is still revered by the Hindoos
to this day. In that country he assumed the name
of Manu, so that the children of Israel who were in
Palestine might not recognise him and claim him as
their sovereign. The precept is this:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This Law-giver’s moral teaching extended all over
the Eastern world, including Corea and Japan, and
thence to the western shores of the American continent;
so that when his earthly course was finished,
the dwellers in all these countries founded religions
based on his precepts, making his memory the object
of their worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Mexicans and Peruvians held him and his
followers in such reverence, and were so confident
that some day he would revisit them, that, when the
Spaniards appeared among them, they mistook them
for the expected visitors, and were ready to worship
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is related that “Viracocho, the eighth Inca,
beheld in a vision a man of majestic form, with a long
beard, and garments reaching to the ground, who
declared that he was a child of the sun. That
monarch built a temple in honour of this person, and
erected an image of him, resembling as nearly as
possible the singular form in which he had appeared
to him. In this temple divine honours were paid to
him under the name of Viracocho.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When the Spaniards first appeared in Peru, the
length of their beards, and the dress they wore, struck
everybody as so like to the image of Viracocho,
that they supposed them to be children of the sun,
who had descended from heaven to earth. All
concluded that the last days of the Peruvian Empire
were at hand, and that the throne would be occupied
by new rulers. Atahualpa himself, considering the
Spaniards as messengers from heaven, was so far
from entertaining any thoughts of resisting them,
that he determined to yield implicit obedience to
their commands. From these sentiments flowed his
professions of love and respect; to these were owing
the cordial reception of Soto and Ferdinand Pizarro
in his camp, and the submissive reverence with which
he himself advanced to visit the Spanish general in
his quarters.”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c007'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The same idolatrous worship is paid in Japan and
China to the memory of the Law-giver Moses, who
was the founder and sovereign of these Empires. In
Japan this mode of worship is called Shintoism, and
in China Confucianism. The institutor of the latter
was Confucius. After him came his disciple Laou-tsze,
who wrote a book containing five thousand
characters; on this he constructed the modern
Chinese religion. The book is called Taou-tih-King;
the religion, Taouism.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The first chapter of the Taou-tih-King tells us
that, ‘that which is nameless is the beginning of
heaven and earth,’ and elsewhere we are let into
the secret of the processes which led up to this
creation. Taou produced one, the first great cause;
one produced two, the male and female principles of
nature; two produced three; and three produced all
things, beginning with heaven and earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Heaven is treated by Laou-tsze much in the
same way as by Confucius, but with far more reserve.
In the utterances of both teachers we find the word
used to designate the material heaven as well as a
personified heaven. Just as Confucius speaks of the
Sage as being the equal of heaven, Laou-tsze says
that he is the associate of heaven, and that he is
heaven itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Heaven, also according to him, gives laws to the
earth, just as it takes its laws from Taou. It has no
special love, but regards all existing beings as grass-dogs
made for sacrificial rites, <i>i.e.</i> for temporary
purposes. It is as unselfish as it is impartial, and
because it does not aim at life it lasts long. It is
great and compassionate, and is ever ready to become
the saviour of men. But it is also the material
heaven, and maintains its existence by the ‘clearness’
which is imparted to it by its unity with
Taou.”<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c007'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These religious systems are at the present time to
a great extent superseded by Buddhism. This
religion has many followers, and its tenets are known
throughout the East, in Thibet, Central Asia, Siberia,
and even as far west as Swedish Lapland.</p>

<p class='c006'>The founder of Buddhism was born on the borders
of Nepaul about <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 620, and was heir to the throne
of Kapilavastu. Renouncing his claim, he made
himself known to the world as the Buddha Gautama,
whose advent was foretold by the Brahmans. It had
been predicted that either he would live among men
and become a Chacawati, or mighty ruler, whose
sway all the human race would acknowledge; or,
withdrawing from the world, he would become a
recluse, and in that condition, after disentangling
himself from the miseries of existence, would become
a Buddha, and remove the veils of ignorance and sin
from the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tribe to which belonged the father of Gautama,
whose name was Suddhódana, was called Sākya. His
mother’s name was Mâya, “daughter of Supra-buddha,
chief of the neighbouring and kindred tribe
of Kolyans. Both tribes were of pure Aryan race,
and branches of the Suryavansi, or line of the
Sun.”<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c007'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>All statues of Guatama represent him with short
points of hair on the top of the head; in some the
hair has a curled or woolly appearance. This,
together with other circumstances, proves that the
Sage descended from the Ethiopian Colonisers who
entered India with Moses. Some of the precepts of
the Buddha resemble those of Our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, who preached six hundred years later,
though there are some differences of doctrine.
Gautama abolished sacrifices, and taught the law of
Love and Charity, and the reward of obedience; also
the liberation of the soul from self, with its absorption
into the Infinite, or the Finite lost in the Infinite and
the Mortal in the Immortal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The invocation which he taught his disciples was
addressed to the Spirit in the Lotus, a mystical
reference to the preservation of the Founder of his
tribe—the Hebrew infant cast on the bosom of the
sacred Nile in a cradle of bulrushes. The Trinity
of the Buddhists, also, is analogous to the Trinity of
the Egyptians—the Osiris, Isis, and their son Horus,
signifying Moses (rescued from the water) and his
Ethiopian consort Tharbis, and their son (represented
in paintings in Thebes).</p>

<p class='c006'>About six hundred years after Gautama’s death
Our Lord Jesus Christ entered the world. His
coming was expected by the followers of the last
Buddha, insomuch that the Brahmans came to Judea
in search of the Infant, whose birth was made known
to them by a bright, extraordinary star.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mission of the Saviour was to fulfil the predictions
of the Hebrew Scriptures, that, by His death,
the world might be restored to the favour of God.
And the reward of His Sacrifice of Himself on man’s
behalf will be the restoration of God’s favour to His
erring creatures, so that, in the fulness of time, the
Lord God will again walk with man on earth, in the
cool of the day, as He did in the days of Adam’s
innocency in the Garden of Eden.</p>

    <div><i>A Narrative of the Great Famine in the Land of Egypt,</i></div>
    <div><i>as recorded in the Talmud.</i><a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c007'><sup>[91]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Pharaoh the King issued a proclamation throughout
the whole land of Egypt to the wise men thereof.
And he called upon all the wise men to seek his
presence and listen to the dreams which troubled
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He who can properly interpret to me the meaning
of these visions shall have his dearest wishes granted
as they issue from his lips; but he who is able to
read dreams and neglects my bidding shall surely be
put to death.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the wise men, and the soothsayers, and the
magicians of the land of Egypt, came and stood
before the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the King related to them his dream, and
though many interpreted, no two agreed as to its
meaning. They contradicted one another, and they
served but to confuse the King. Many were the
interpretations.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The seven fat cows,” said one, “are seven kings
who will arise over Egypt from royal families, and
the seven lean cows are seven princes who will arise
from them, and in the end of days destroy the seven
kings. The seven rank ears are seven great princes
of this land who shall in a coming time of war fall
into the power of seven princes, now weak and in no
wise to be feared.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The seven fat cows,” said another, “are seven
queens whom thou shalt marry in the coming days,
and the seven lean cows declare that these queens
shall die during thy life, O King! The seven rank
ears and the seven lean ears are fourteen children
whom thou shalt beget, and they will fight among
themselves, and the seven weaker ones shall conquer
their stronger brethren.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But the King was not satisfied with these interpretations.
His mind was still unquiet, for the Lord
had ordained that Joseph was to be released from his
prison and elevated to a princely position; therefore
did Pharaoh remain unsatisfied with the words of his
wise men.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the King was wroth, and he dismissed the
wise men from his presence; and all the wise men
and the soothsayers and magicians of Egypt went out
from the presence of their King in shame and confusion.
And the King commanded in his wrath that
all these men should be put to death.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the chief butler heard this he sought the
presence of the King, and in deep obeisance before
him spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>“O King, live for ever! May thy greatness, O
King, increase for ever through the land. Lo, thou
wast wroth with thy servant, and thou didst place
him in confinement. For a year was I imprisoned,
I and the chief baker. And with us in our dungeon
was a Hebrew servant who belonged to the captain
of the guard. His name was Joseph, and his master
growing wroth with him, had placed him in prison,
where he served the captain of the guard, and he
served us also.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And it came to pass when we had been in the
prison for a year we dreamed, each, a dream, and the
Hebrew slave interpreted for each of us his dream.
And lo, as he interpreted our dreams so was the
reality. As he spoke so did it come to pass.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Therefore, my lord King, I pray thee, do not
kill the wise men of Egypt for naught. Behold,
this slave is still in the prison. If it be pleasing in
the eyes of the King let him be sent for. Let him
listen to the dreams which trouble the mind of the
King, and he will be able to solve them correctly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The King listened to the words of the chief butler,
and he ordered that Joseph should be brought before
him. But he commanded his officers to be careful
not to frighten the lad, lest through fear he should
be unable to interpret correctly.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the servants of the King brought Joseph
forth from his dungeon, and shaved him and clothed
him in new garments, and carried him before the
King. The King was seated upon his throne, and
the glare and glitter of the jewels which ornamented
the throne dazzled and astonished the eyes of
Joseph.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the throne of the King was reached by seven
steps, and it was the custom of Egypt for a prince or
noble who held audience with the King, to ascend
to the sixth step; but when an inferior or a private
citizen of the land was called into his presence, the
King descended to the third step and from there
spoke with him. So when Joseph came into the
presence of the King he bowed to the ground at the
foot of the throne, and the King descended to the
third step and spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>And he said:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Behold, I have dreamed a dream, and among all
the wise men and magicians of the land there is not
one able to read for me its meaning. I have heard
that thou art far-sighted and blest with the gift of
divination, and I have sent for thee to solve my
dream.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph answered:</p>

<p class='c006'>“O King, the power is not with me; but God will
answer and give Pharaoh peace.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph found favour in the eyes of the King,
and he told to him his dream. And the spirit of God
was upon Joseph, and the King inclined his ears and
heart to the words of Joseph.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph said to Pharaoh:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let not the King think that his dreams are two
and distinct; they have but a single portent, and
what the Lord intends doing upon the earth He has
shown to Pharaoh in a vision. Let me advise thee,
O King, how thou mayest preserve thy life and the
lives of all the inhabitants of thy land from the
grievous evils of the famine which is soon to drain
and dry up its fruitfulness and its plenty. Let the
King appoint a man wise and discreet, a man well
versed in the laws of the country, and let him appoint
other officers under him to go out through all the
length and breadth of the land to gather food during
the years of plenty and store it carefully away for
future use, that the land may not die in the years of
famine which will follow. And let the King command
the people of the land, that they shall each and
every one gather and store up in the years of plenty
of the produce of the fields, to provide for their wants
when the ground shall be barren and the fields
unproductive.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the King answered, “How knowest thou that
thou hast read the dream aright?”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph said, “Lo, this shall be a sign that
my words are true. A son shall be born to the King,
and upon the day of his birth, thy first-born son, who
is now two years old, shall die.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And when Joseph finished speaking these words,
he bowed low before the King and departed from his
presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The occurrence which Joseph predicted came to
pass. The queen bore a son, and upon the day
when it was told to the King he rejoiced greatly.
But as the messenger of glad tidings retired, the servants
of the King found his first-born son dead, and
there was a great crying and wailing in the palace of
the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when Pharaoh inquired as to the cause of this
great cry he was informed of his loss, and remembering
the words of Joseph he acknowledged them as
true.</p>

<p class='c006'>After these things the King sent and gathered
together all his princes, officers, and men of rank,
and when they came before him, he said: “You have
seen and heard all the words of this Hebrew, and
you know that as he spoke so has the thing occurred;
therefore must we believe that his solution of my
dream was the correct one, and that his words of
advice were of good weight and consideration. We
must take measures of protection against the famine
which is surely to come upon us. Therefore search,
I pray you, over all Egypt for a man with wisdom
and knowledge in his heart, that we may appoint him
over the land.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And they answered the King: “The advice of
this Hebrew was very good; behold, the country is
in the hands of the King to do with it what is
pleasing in his eyes; but the Hebrew has proved
himself wise and skilful, why should our lord the King
not select and appoint him as governor over the land?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yea, surely,” said the King, “if God has made
these things known to the Hebrew, then there is none
among us as wise and discreet as he is. What you
have suggested is in accordance with my own
thoughts; we will appoint the Hebrew our governor,
and through his wisdom shall our country be saved
the pangs of want.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Pharaoh sent for Joseph and said to him:
“Thou didst advise me to appoint a wise and discreet
man to deliver the land from the anguish of famine.
Surely, there can be none more discreet than thyself
to whom God has made known all these things. Thy
name shall no more be Joseph, but ‘Zaphenath-Päaneah’
(Revealer of hidden things) shalt thou
hereafter be called among men.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thou shalt be second to me only, and according
to thy words shall the land of Egypt be ruled; only
upon the throne shall I be greater than thyself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the King removed his ring from his finger
and placed it upon the hand of Joseph. And he
dressed Joseph in royal apparel, and placed a crown
upon his head and a chain of gold about his neck.
And Pharaoh commanded that Joseph should ride in
his second chariot throughout the land of Egypt.
And the people followed him with music, and a large
concourse accompanied him upon his journey.</p>

<p class='c006'>Five thousand soldiers with drawn swords in their
hands, swords glittering in the sunlight, preceded
him, and twenty thousand soldiers followed. And
the people of the land, men, women, and children,
gazed upon the pageant from windows and from
house-tops, and the beauty of Joseph pleased all
eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>And flowers were strewn in his path when he
walked, and the air was made sweet with perfume,
and the savoury odour of balms and spices. And
proclamations were placed in prominent places declaring
the authority of Joseph, and threatening
death to those who failed to pay him homage; for he
was considered as dishonouring his King who failed
to honour the man made second in the kingdom.
The people bowed down and shouted, “Long live the
King and his Viceroy!” And Joseph, seated in his
chariot, lifted his eyes to heaven, and exclaimed in
the fulness of his heart, “He raiseth the poor from
the dust; from the dunghill He lifteth up the needy.
O Lord of Hosts, happy is the man who trusteth in
thee!”</p>

<p class='c006'>And it came to pass after this, that Joseph saw
Osnath, the daughter of Potipharah, a pearl among
the beauties of the land, and he loved her and she
became his wife. And Joseph was but thirty years
old when he was elevated to his honourable and
trustworthy position. He built for himself a palace,
elegant and complete in its details and surroundings,
so elaborate that three years’ time was required for
its completion. And the Lord was with Joseph, and
increased his wisdom and understanding, and blessed
him with manners so affable and deserving that he
quickly won the love and favour of all the inhabitants
of the country.</p>

<p class='c006'>And during seven years, as Joseph had foretold,
the Lord increased the produce of Egypt sevenfold.
And Joseph appointed officers to gather up the
plenty. They built huge storehouses<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c007'><sup>[92]</sup></a> and heaped
up corn during the seven years of plenty, till the
amount stored grew so great that no man could
number it. And Joseph and his officers were watchful
and diligent that their stores of grain should not
suffer from moth or mould. The people of the land,
too, stored up their surplus crop, but they were not
as careful and watchful as was Joseph and his
assistants.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the wife of Joseph bore him two sons, Manassah
and Ephraim, and their father taught them
diligently the way of truth; they listened to his
words and departed not from the paths of pleasantness
either to the right hand or to the left.</p>

<p class='c006'>They grew up bright and intelligent lads, and were
honoured among the people as were the children of
the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the seven years of plenty drew to an end, and
the fields became barren and the trees gave forth no
fruit, and the famine which Joseph had predicted
threw its gloomy shadow and threatening presence
over the once fruitful land.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when the people opened their storehouses,
they found to their sorrow that moth and mould had
taken advantage of their neglect. And they cried
aloud to Pharaoh, “Give us food; let us not die of
hunger before thee, we and our children; give to us,
we pray thee, from the plenty of thy storehouses.”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c007'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>And Pharaoh answered, “Why cry ye unto me,
O careless people? did Joseph not tell ye of the
famine which has come upon us? Why did ye not
hearken to his voice, and obey his commands to be
frugal and painstaking?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“By thy life, our lord,” replied the people, “as
Joseph spoke, so did we, and gathered in our corn
during the years of plenty, but lo, when the pangs of
hunger and the barrenness of the land bid us open
our granaries, the moth had destroyed the provisions
which we had garnered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The King became alarmed lest all their precaution
should prove unavailing against the famine’s blight,
and he bade the people to go to Joseph. “Obey his
commands and rebel not against his words.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the people repeated to Joseph the cry for food
they had addressed to Pharaoh.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Joseph heard the words of the people and
learned the result of their want of care, he opened
the storehouses of the King and sold food unto the
hungry people.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the famine grew sore in the land of Egypt
and spread through Canaan and the land of the
Philistines, and to the other side of the Jordan. And
when the inhabitants of these countries heard that
corn could be obtained in Egypt, they came all of
them into that country to buy, so that Joseph was
obliged to appoint many officers to sell corn to the
large multitude of people.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph’s thoughts reverted to his father’s
home, and he knew that his brothers would be obliged
to come to Egypt to purchase food, for the famine
was very grievous in their neighbourhood. Therefore
he gave orders that no man desiring corn should
send his servant to purchase it, but the head of each
family should personally appear as a purchaser;
either the father of a family or his sons. He proclaimed
also, as the order of the King and his viceroy,
that no man should be allowed to purchase corn in
Egypt to sell it again in other countries, but only
such as he required for the support of his immediate
family; neither should any purchaser be allowed to
buy more corn than one animal could carry.</p>

<p class='c006'>And he put guards at all the gates of Egypt, and
every man who passed through the gates was obliged
to record his name and the name of his father in a
book, which was brought by the guards every night
for Joseph’s inspection.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus did Joseph design to ascertain when his
brothers came to buy food; and all the commands
which he had given were faithfully executed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, when the patriarch Jacob learned that food
could be purchased in Egypt, he bade his sons proceed
thither and obtain a stock of provisions, for the
famine was growing very severe, and he feared that
his family would suffer from its pangs. Jacob instructed
his sons to enter the city by different gates,
so that no objection should be made to the amount of
their purchases; and as he commanded, so they did.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus did the sons of Jacob go down to Egypt,
and while upon the way they thought of their brother
Joseph, and their hearts chid them for their cruelty
towards him, and they said one to the other:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Behold, we know that Joseph was carried down
to Egypt; now, when we come to the city let us seek
for him, perchance we may discover his whereabouts,
and then we will redeem him from his master.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And so did Jacob’s ten sons travel to Egypt.
Benjamin was not with them, for his father feared
that mischief might befall him as it did the other
son of Rachel, and he kept him at home by his side.</p>

<p class='c006'>By ten different gates did the ten sons of the
patriarch enter into the land of Egypt, and the
guards at the gates took down their names, which
were sent with the other names to Joseph at the
close of the day. When Joseph read the names he
commanded that all the storehouses<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c007'><sup>[94]</sup></a> save one should
be closed, and he ordered further, that every purchaser
at this storehouse should be required to give
his name; and mentioning the names of his brethren,
he said, “If these men come before ye, see that ye
seize them, every one.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When the sons of Jacob had entered the city they
met together, and before buying their corn they resolved
to make a thorough search for their brother.
They visited all places of public resort, and the
houses of divination, but though they continued their
search for three days, it proved unavailing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now when three days had passed, and his brothers
had not put in an appearance at the storehouse,
Joseph wondered at their delay, and he sent sixteen
of his servants to search for them quietly through the
city. They were found among the Egyptian players,
and brought straightway before the viceroy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Joseph was seated upon his throne dressed in his
royal apparel, with his officers around him, when his
brothers bowed to the ground before him. They
wondered exceedingly at the magnificence, the handsome
appearance and the majestic presence of the
powerful man before them, but they did not recognise
in him their brother.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph spoke to them, saying, “Whence
came ye?” “From the land of Canaan,” they
answered, “and to buy food, for lo! the famine is
sore in the land; and thy servants learning that corn
might be purchased in Egypt, have journeyed hither
to provide for their support and the support of their
families.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Joseph said, “Nay, ye are spies, else why did
ye enter the city by ten different gates?”</p>

<p class='c006'>They answered, “We are true men; thy servants
have never been spies. Thy servants are brothers,
the sons of one father, and by his command did we
enter the city separately, for coming together he
feared our appearance might attract unfavourable
attention.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Joseph repeated, “Ye are spies; to spy out
the nakedness of our land have ye come. Behold,
every man who comes to buy corn, makes his purchase
and departs; but ye, lo, three days have ye
been in the city, in public places and among the
players; it is as I have spoken, ye are spies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“God forbid!” they exclaimed; “our lord misjudges
us. We are altogether twelve brothers, the
sons of Jacob, in the land of Canaan; Jacob, the son
of Isaac, and grandson of Abraham the Hebrew.
Behold, our youngest brother is with his father, we
ten are here, and the other brother, alas, he is not
with us, we know not where he is. We thought
perchance he might be in your land, therefore have
we searched all public places these three days.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And what should the son of Jacob be doing in
the public places?” asked Joseph.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We heard,” they answered, “that the Ishmaelites
had sold him in Egypt, and being of very handsome
appearance, we thought he might have been sold in
one of the play-houses, therefore we went there hoping
to find and to redeem him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suppose you had found him,” said Joseph, “and
his master had asked for him an enormous amount of
money; were you prepared to comply with extraordinary
demands?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The brothers answered in the affirmative, and
Joseph continued:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suppose again that you should find him and his
master should refuse to sell or deliver him to you
under any circumstances, what would you do in such
a case?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In such a case,” they answered, “if neither
prayers nor money should prove of avail, we would
rescue our brother by violence: aye, even the death
of his master, and flee with him to our father’s
house.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is as I have said,” retorted Joseph; “ye are
spies; lo, with evil designs upon the inhabitants of
our city ye have come. We have heard and know
indeed how ye killed all the males of Shechem in the
land of Canaan on your sister’s account, and now ye
would treat the men of Egypt in the same way for
the sake of a brother. But yet we will give ye an
opportunity to prove yourselves true men. Send
one of your number to your father’s house to bring
hither the youngest brother of whom you have
spoken. If ye will do this, I shall know that you
have spoken truly. Take three days to consider.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And in obedience to Joseph’s commands his
brothers were held in ward for three days.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this time the brothers concluded to leave
one of their number as a hostage, while the others
returned to Canaan to bring Benjamin down to
Egypt. So Menasseh, the son of Joseph, chose
Simeon as the hostage, and he was kept in ward.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ere his brothers departed, Joseph spoke to them
once more. “Take heed,” said he, “that ye forget
not my commands. If ye bring this brother to me,
I shall consider ye true men, and ye shall be free to
traffic in the land; neither will I do harm to your
brother; he shall be at liberty to return with ye to
your father’s house in peace.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They bowed down to the ground and departed
from Egypt. As they proceeded upon their homeward
journey, they stopped at an inn to feed their
asses, and Levi opened his sack to provide the corn
for the meal. And lo, when he opened the sack, his
money which he had paid for the corn was lying on
the top. And he was exceedingly afraid, and he
told the thing to his brethren, and they, too, were
filled with alarm. And when every man found his
money returned they cried aloud:</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is this that God has done to us? Has
the Lord withdrawn from us the mercy which He
showed to our ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and
to Jacob, that He has given us into the hands of
Egypt’s prince to mock us and make merry with
us?”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Judah said, “It is just! Are we not guilty
and sinful before the Lord? We sold our brother,
our flesh. Why should we now complain that the
favour God has lavished on our ancestors is denied
to us?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did I not warn ye, ‘sin not against the child?’”
said Reuben, “and ye would not hearken to my
words. His blood is upon us. Why do ye say,
therefore, ‘Where is the kindness which the Lord
promised unto our fathers?’ Verily we have
forfeited His protection.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Jacob’s sons approached their home, and
the patriarch came forth to meet them, he quickly
missed the face of Simeon, and he asked, “Where
is Simeon, your brother?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the brothers told their father all that had
happened to them in Egypt, and Jacob said to them:
“What is this that ye have done to me? Your
brother Joseph I sent to ye to inquire of your welfare,
and his face I looked upon no more,—his bloody
garments ye brought me, saying, ‘Lo, the wild
beasts of the forest have destroyed thy son.’ Simeon
I sent with ye to purchase food, and ye tell me that
he is imprisoned in a cruel land; and now Benjamin
ye wish to take also,—for Joseph and for Benjamin ye
would bring my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.
No, my son shall not go with ye.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Reuben said, “The lives of my two sons I
place in your hands; if we do not bring back Benjamin
safely to thee, their lives shall prove the
forfeit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Jacob said, “Neither shall ye return again to
Egypt; stay here, for my son shall not go with ye,
to die as did his brother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Judah said to his brothers, “Urge him no
more at present. Let us wait until these provisions
have been consumed, and when cruel want and
hunger press us he will consent to what we ask.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And it came to pass when the provisions were
gone, that the sons of his children gathered around
Jacob and cried to him, “Oh, give us bread.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the heart of Jacob was torn with anguish at
the cry, and summoning his sons, he said to them,
“Hear ye not the voices of your children crying for
food? ‘Give us bread,’ they cried to me, and I—I
have none to give them. Get ye down to Egypt,
I pray ye, and buy us a little food.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Judah answered, and said to his father, “If
thou wilt send Benjamin with us, we will go,—otherwise
we cannot. The King of Egypt is a mighty
potentate; we dare not trifle with him. Should we
return to Egypt, and our youngest brother be not
with us, lo, he would destroy us all. Our father, we
cannot disobey this King; greater even is he than
Abimelech, the Philistine. Thou hast not seen, as
we have, his throne, his palace, his myriads of
officers; thou hast not witnessed, as have we, his
wisdom, knowledge, and understanding. God has
blessed him with unequalled gifts; greater is he
than all on earth beside. Our names he told us;
what had happened to us in our youth; he inquired
of thee, saying, ‘Is your father yet alive? Are all
things well with him?’ Thou hast not heard, as we
have, of his power; over his people he is supreme;
upon his word they go out, and upon his word they
come in; his word governs, and the voice of his
master, Pharaoh, is not required. Oh, my father,
send the lad,—we cannot go without him; if thou
refusest, we must see our children die with hunger.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Jacob said, in his sorrow: “Why did ye tell
the man ye had a brother? Oh, evil, evil is this
thing which ye have done!” “Give the boy into
my hands,” said Judah, “and let us go down to
Egypt and buy the corn. If I do not return him
safely to thee, a sinner against my father shall I be
considered all my days. Our children weep before
thee, and we have naught to stay their cries; have
mercy on them, send our brother with us. Hast
thou not often told us of the mercy which our God
has promised to thee? Lo, He will protect thy son
and return him to thee safely. Pray unto the Lord
for our sakes, entreat Him to give us grace and
favour in the eyes of Egypt’s prince. Lo, had we
not tarried thus long, we should have now been back
with food; yea, back twice to thee, and with thy son
in safety.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Jacob answered: “The Lord God give you
grace in the eyes of the King and officers of Egypt.
In Him will I put my trust. Arise, go unto the
man, take with ye gifts, the best the land affords;
the Lord will be with ye, and ye shall bring back to
me your brothers, Benjamin and Simeon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the sons of Jacob went down again to Egypt.
And they took Benjamin with them, and they took,
also, presents and twofold money.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Take heed of the lad,” were Jacob’s parting
words; “separate not from him either in Egypt or
upon the road”; and when they had gone, he sought
the presence of the Almighty in prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the wives of Jacob’s sons, and his grandchildren,
they, too, lifted their eyes and hearts to
Heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jacob also addressed the following letter, to be
delivered by his sons into the hands of Joseph:</p>

<p class='c006'>“From thy servant, Jacob, the son of Isaac, the
son of Abraham the Hebrew.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The prince of God unto the mighty and wise
King Zaphenath-Päaneah, the King of Egypt, peace.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My lord, the King, knows well that the famine is
sore in the land of Canaan; therefore I sent my sons
to thee to buy food for our sustenance. I charged
them not to enter the city by the same gate, lest
coming together they might attract the attention of
the inhabitants. And, lo, their obedience to my
orders has caused them to be accused by thee as
spies. Oh, my lord, could not an intelligent man,
such as thou art, read truth upon the faces of my
sons? Much have I heard of thy wisdom and the
understanding which thou didst display in the interpretation
of Pharaoh’s dreams, in foretelling this
grievous famine,—how, then, was it possible that thou
shouldst suspect my sons?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Behold, I am surrounded with children; I am
very old, and my eyes wax dim; tearful have they
been for twenty years in lamenting the loss of my
son Joseph, and now I have sent to thee his brother
Benjamin as thou didst command; I pray thee, O
my lord, to be good to him, and return him to me
with his brothers. The strength of God has ever
been with us; He has listened to our prayers, and
He has never forsaken us; protect thou my son who
is coming unto thee, and God will look favourably
upon thee and upon thy kingdom. Send him home
again with his brothers, and Simeon also send with
them in peace.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This letter was entrusted into Judah’s hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus the sons of Jacob went down again to Egypt
with Benjamin and with the presents, and they stood
before Joseph. And Joseph released Simeon from
prison, and restored him to his brethren. And
Simeon told them of the kind treatment which he had
received since their departure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Judah took Benjamin and brought him
before Joseph, and they prostrated themselves to the
ground. And the brothers gave Joseph the presents
which their father had sent to him. And Joseph
asked them whether all went well with their children
and with their old father, and they answered, “It is
well with all of us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Judah delivered his father’s letter to Joseph,
and the latter recognised his father’s hand, and his
feelings grew too strong for him; the recollections of
his youth overpowered him, and retiring into a side
apartment he wept bitterly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Returning to the presence of his brothers, Joseph’s
eyes rested upon Benjamin, his mother’s son, and he
asked, “Is this your youngest brother of whom ye
told me?” And when Benjamin drew near, Joseph
laid his hand upon his brother’s head, and said, “God
be gracious unto thee, my son.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then restraining his feelings, he ordered his officers
to prepare the dining-tables.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then when the meal was ready Joseph took into
his hand a cup,—a cup of solid silver, set with precious
stones, and holding it in his hand in the
presence of his brothers, Joseph said, “I know by
this cup that Reuben is the first-born of your father,
therefore shall he sit first, and Simeon, Levi, Judah,
Issachar, and Zebulun shall follow him in this order,
according to their ages; the rest shall follow these
according to their ages.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And he said further, “I know that your youngest
brother has no mother, neither have I a mother,
therefore will we two sit together.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the men marvelled much at the words of
Joseph, as they ate and drank with Joseph upon that
day.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the morning Joseph dismissed his brethren, and
bade them return to their father in peace. But when
they had departed he called his servants, and ordered
them to pursue after, overtake them, and bring them
back.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when the servants of Joseph overtook them,
and said to them, “Why have ye done this thing to
steal our master’s cup?” the brothers of Joseph were
indignant, and they answered, “If ye find the cup
in the possession of any one of us, lo, he shall die,
and we, his brethren, shall be your master’s slaves”;
but when the cup was found where Joseph had
ordered it to be put, in Benjamin’s sack, they returned,
grieving and crestfallen, to the presence of
Joseph.</p>

<p class='c006'>The viceroy was seated upon his throne, and his
officers of state were gathered about him when his
brethren entered, and speaking roughly to them, he
said: “What evil deed is this which you have
wrought? Why did ye take my silver cup? Is it
because you could not find that brother you spoke
of in the country that you stole the cup instead?
Answer and tell me why have ye done this thing?”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Judah spoke, saying, “What shall we say
unto my lord? What shall we speak, for how shall
we justify ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity
of thy servants, and sent this calamity upon us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Joseph arose, and grasping hold of Benjamin
he led him to another room, and pushing him therein
closed the door upon him. He then told the others
to return to their homes in peace, saying, “I will
keep the one in whose possession the cup was found;
return ye in peace.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Judah answered: “Know that I became a
surety with our father for the lad’s safe return. ‘If
he comes not back with us,’ I said, ‘lo, I shall be
considered as sinning before thee all my days.’ Oh,
my lord, let me find grace in thy eyes; let me but
take the lad home to his father, and I will return to
take his place as thy servant. See, I am stronger
and older than he is, let me be thy servant instead
of Benjamin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Upon one condition,” replied Joseph, “the lad
may go with you. Bring before me his brother, his
mother’s son of whom you have spoken, and I will
take him in place of Benjamin. You did become a
surety for him to your father, therefore let me have
him, and the brother for whom you did become a
surety shall return home with you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Simeon drew near and answered: “Did we
not tell my lord, when first we came before him, that
this lost brother we could not find? Wherefore will
my lord speak such idle words? We know not, alas!
whether this brother be alive or dead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suppose, then,” said Joseph, “that I should call
him before me, will ye then give him to me in place of
Benjamin?” And, raising his voice, he called aloud,
“Joseph! Joseph! appear Joseph, and sit before thy
brethren.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The sons of Jacob wondered much at these words,
and their blood grew chill as they looked around in
fear and amazement to see from whence their brother
was to appear.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph said to them: “Why do ye look
around? Your brother is before you. I am Joseph
whom ye sold to Egypt. But nay, be not alarmed,
ye were but instruments, and to save life did God
send me hither.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the men were much frightened, and Judah
especially was terrified at the startling words. Benjamin,
who was in the inner court, heard them,
and hurrying before Joseph, he threw himself upon
the latter’s breast, and kissing him, they wept together.
The other brothers too were much affected,
and the people about wondered, and the report of
the occurrence reached Pharaoh’s palace.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pharaoh was pleased with the news, and sent a
deputation of his officers to welcome Joseph’s
brethren, and to bid them, in his name, to bring their
families and their household goods and make their
homes in Egypt.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph clad his brethren in new and elegant
garments, and made them many generous presents,
and gave to each of them three hundred pieces of
silver; and then he took them before Pharaoh and
introduced them to the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when Pharaoh saw what goodly men the sons
of Jacob were he was much pleased and very gracious
towards them.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when it became time for them to return to
Canaan, Joseph procured eleven of Pharaoh’s chariots
and added to them his own, for their accommodation.
And he sent rich presents to his father, and garments
and presents to the children of his brothers and
sister, and to his brothers’ wives. And he accompanied
his brethren upon their journey to the boundaries
of Egypt, and parting with them, he said:
“Do not, my brethren, quarrel on the way. This
thing was wrought through God’s wisdom; ye were
but the instruments to save from famine and hunger
a vast multitude.” He also commanded them to be
careful in imparting the great news they carried to
their father, lest speaking suddenly, it might have a
bad effect upon so old a man. And the sons of
Jacob returned unto the land of Canaan in gladness
with happy hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'>And it came to pass when they drew near to
Canaan that they said one to the other, “How shall
we break this news unto our father? We cannot tell
him suddenly that Joseph is still alive.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But it chanced when they reached Beer-Shebah
that Serach, the daughter of Asher, came to meet
her father and her uncles. And Serach was a sweet
singer, and she played upon the harp. So they said
unto her, “Take thy harp, and go and sit before our
father and play to him, and as thou playest, sing;
sing of his son Joseph, and let him know in this
manner that Joseph lives.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the maiden did as she was bid, and sitting
before her grandfather, she sang to him a song,
wherein she repeated seven times these words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lo, Joseph is not dead; he lives,</div>
      <div class='line'>My uncle rules o’er Egypt’s land.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And Jacob was pleased with her singing and playing;
happiness seemed to find birth in his heart at
her sweet voice, and he smiled upon the maiden and
blessed her. And while he was talking to her his
sons arrived with their horses and chariots, and
Jacob arose and met them at the door, and they said
to him, “We have joyful tidings for our father.
Joseph, our brother, is still alive, and he is ruler
over all the land of Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Jacob remained cool and unaffected, for he
did not believe their words, until he saw the presents
which Joseph had sent, and all the signs of his greatness;
then his eyes brightened and gladness sparkled
in their depths, and he said: “Enough, my son
lives; I will go and see him before I die.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the inhabitants of Beer-Shebah and the surrounding
countries heard the news, and came and
congratulated Jacob, and he made a great feast for
them. And he said, “I will go down to Egypt and
see my son, and then will I return to Canaan, as the
Lord has spoken to Abraham, giving this land unto
his seed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the word of the Lord came to Jacob, saying,
“Go down to Egypt; be not afraid, for I am with
thee, and will make of thee a great nation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And Jacob commanded his sons and their families
to prepare to go down with him to Egypt, as the
Lord had spoken, and they arose and started upon
the way. And Jacob sent Judah in advance, to announce
his coming and to select a place for his
residence.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when Joseph learned that his father was upon
the way he gathered together his friends and officers,
and soldiers of the realm, and they attired themselves
in rich garments and gold and silver ornaments, and
the troops were armed with all the implements of
war, and they gathered together and formed a great
company to meet Jacob upon the way and escort him
to Egypt. Music and gladness filled the land, and
all the people, the women and the children, assembled
upon the house-tops to view the magnificent display.</p>

<p class='c006'>Joseph was dressed in royal robes, with the crown
of state upon his head; and when he came within
fifty cubits of his father’s company, he descended
from his chariot and walked to meet his father. And
when the nobles and princes saw this, they too descended
from their steeds and chariots and walked
with him.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when Jacob saw all this great procession he
wondered exceedingly, and he was much pleased
thereat, and turning to Judah he asked, “Who is the
man who marcheth at the head of this great array in
royal robes?” and Judah answered, “That is thy
son.” And when Joseph drew nigh to his father he
bowed down before him, and his officers also bowed
low to Jacob.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Jacob ran towards his son and fell upon his
neck and kissed him, and they wept. And Joseph
greeted his brethren with affection.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Jacob said to Joseph, “Now let me die. I
have seen thy face; my eyes have beheld thee living
and in great honour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the great company escorted Jacob and his
family to Egypt, and there Joseph gave to his relatives
the best of the land, even Goshen.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Joseph lived in the land and governed it
wisely. And the two sons of Joseph were great
favourites with their grandfather, and were ever in
his house.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c007'><sup>[95]</sup></a> And Jacob taught them the ways of the
Lord, and pointed out to them the path of happiness
and peace in His service.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Jacob and his family lived in Goshen, and
had possession of the land and multiplied therein
exceedingly.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c007'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>When Alexander had reigned twelve years, and after
him Ptolemy Soter forty years, Philadelphus then
took the kingdom of Egypt, and held it forty years
within one. He procured the law to be interpreted,
and set free those that were come from Jerusalem
into Egypt, and were in slavery there, who were a
hundred and twenty thousand. The occasion was
this:—Demetrius Phalerius, who was library-keeper
to the King, was now endeavouring, if it were possible,
to gather together all the books that were in the
habitable earth, and buying whatsoever was anywhere
valuable, or agreeable to the King’s inclination (who
was very earnestly set upon collecting of books); to
which inclination of his, Demetrius was zealously
subservient.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when once Ptolemy asked how many ten
thousands of books he had collected, he replied that
he had already about twenty times ten thousand; but
that, in a little time, he should have fifty times ten
thousand.</p>

<p class='c006'>But he said he had been informed that there were
many books of laws among the Jews worthy of inquiring
after, and worthy of the King’s library, but
which, being written in characters and in a dialect of
their own, will cause no small pains in getting them
translated into the Greek tongue: that the character
in which they are written seems to be like to that
which is the proper character of the Syrians, and that
its sound, when pronounced, is like to theirs also;
and that this sound appears to be peculiar to themselves.
Wherefore, he said, that nothing hindered
why they might not get those books to be translated
also; for while nothing is wanting that is necessary
for that purpose, we may have their books also in
this library.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the King thought that Demetrius was very
zealous to procure him abundance of books, and that
he suggested what was exceeding proper for him to
do; and therefore he wrote to the Jewish high priest
that he should act accordingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now there was one Aristeus, who was amongst
the King’s most intimate friends, and, on account of
his modesty, very acceptable to him. This Aristeus
resolved frequently, and that before now, to petition
the King that he would set all the captive Jews in
his kingdom free; and he though this to be a convenient
opportunity for the making that petition. So
he discoursed, in the first place, with the captains of
the King’s guards, Sosibius of Tarentum and Andreas,
and persuaded them to assist him in what he was
going to intercede with the King for.</p>

<p class='c006'>Accordingly, Aristeus embraced the same opinion
with those that have been before mentioned, and
went to the King and made the following speech to
him: “It is not fit for us, O King, to overlook
things hastily, or to deceive ourselves, but to lay the
truth open: for since we have determined not only
to get the laws of the Jews transcribed, but interpreted
also, for thy satisfaction, by what means can
we do this, while so many of the Jews are now slaves
in thy kingdom?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do thou, then, what will be agreeable to thy
magnanimity, and to thy good-nature: free them
from the miserable condition they are in, because that
God, who supporteth thy kingdom, was the author of
their laws, as I have learned by particular inquiry; for
both these people and we also worship the same God,
the framer of all things. We call him, and that
truly, by the name of
Ζηνα
(or life, or Jupiter),
because He breathes life into all men. Wherefore,
do thou restore these men to their own country; and
this do to the honour of God, because these men pay
a peculiarly excellent worship to Him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And know this further, that though I be not of
kin to them by birth, nor one of the same country
with them, yet do I desire these favours to be done
them, since all men are the workmanship of God;
and I am sensible that He is well pleased with those
that do good. I do therefore put up this petition to
thee, to do good to them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Aristeus was saying thus, the King looked
upon him with a cheerful and joyful countenance, and
said, “How many ten thousands dost thou suppose
there are of such as want to be made free?” To
which Andreas replied, as he stood by, and said, “A
few more than ten times ten thousand.” The King
made answer, “And is this a small gift that thou
askest, Aristeus?” But Sosibius, and the rest that
stood by, said that he ought to offer such a thank-offering
as was worthy of his greatness of soul, to
that God who had given him his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>With this answer he was much pleased; and gave
order that when they paid the soldiers their wages,
they should lay down twenty drachmæ for every one
of the slaves. And he promised to publish a magnificent
decree about what they requested, which should
confirm what Aristeus had proposed, and especially
what God willed should be done; whereby, he said,
he would not only set those free who had been led
away captive by his father and his army, but those
who were in his kingdom before, and those also, if
any such there were, who had been brought away
since. And when they said that their redemption-money
would amount to above four hundred talents,
he granted it. A copy of which decree I have
determined to preserve, that the magnanimity of this
king may be made known. Its contents were as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let all those who were soldiers under our father,
and who, when they overran Syria and Phœnicia, and
laid waste Judea, took the Jews captives, and made
them slaves, and brought them into our cities, and
into this country, and then sold them; as also all
those that were in my kingdom before them, and if
there be any that have lately been brought thither,
be made free by those that possess them; and let
them accept of twenty drachmæ for every slave.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And let the soldiers receive this redemption-money
with their pay, but the rest out of the King’s
treasury: for I suppose that they were made captives
without our father’s consent, and against equity;
and that their country was harassed by the insolence
of the soldiers, and that, by removing them into Egypt,
the soldiers have made a great profit by them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Out of regard, therefore, to justice, and out of
pity to those that have been tyrannized over contrary
to equity, I enjoin those that have such Jews in
their service to set them at liberty, upon the receipt
of the before-mentioned sum: and that no one use
any deceit about them, but obey what is here
commanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I will that they give in their names within
three days after the publication of this edict, to such
as are appointed to execute the same, and to produce
the slaves before them also, for I think it will be for
the advantage of my affairs: and let everyone that
will, inform against those that do not obey this
decree; and I will that their estates be confiscated
into the King’s treasury.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When this decree was read to the King, it at
first omitted those Jews that had formerly been
brought, and those brought afterwards, which had
not been distinctly mentioned; so he added these
clauses out of his humanity, and with great generosity.
He also gave order that the payment, which
was likely to be done in a hurry, should be divided
among the King’s ministers, and among the officers
of his treasury.</p>

<p class='c006'>When this was over, what the King had decreed
was quickly brought to a conclusion: and this in no
more than seven days’ time; the number of the talents
paid for the captives being above four hundred and
sixty, and this, because their masters required the
twenty drachmæ for the children also, the King
having, in effect, commanded that these should be
paid for, when he said, in his decree, that they should
receive the fore-mentioned sum for every slave.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now when this had been done after so magnificent
a manner, according to the King’s inclinations, he
gave order to Demetrius to give him in writing his
sentiments concerning the transcribing of the Jewish
books; for no part of the administration is done
rashly by these kings, but all things are managed
with great circumspection. On which account I
have subjoined a copy of these epistles, and set down
the multitude of the vessels sent as gifts (to Jerusalem),
and the construction of every one, that the
exactness of the artificers’ workmanship, as it appeared
to those that saw them, and which workmen
made every vessel, may be made manifest, and this
on account of the excellency of the vessels themselves.
Now the copy of the epistle was to this
purpose:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Demetrius to the great King. When thou, O
King, gavest me a charge concerning the collection
of books that were wanting to fill your library, and
concerning the care that ought to be taken about such
as are imperfect, I have used the utmost diligence
about those matters. And I let you know, that we want
the books of the Jewish legislation, with some others;
for they are written in the Hebrew characters, and,
being in the language of that nation, are to us
unknown.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It hath also happened to them, that they have
been transcribed more carelessly than they should
have been, because they have not had hitherto royal
care taken about them. Now it is necessary that
thou shouldst have accurate copies of them. And
indeed this legislation is full of hidden wisdom, and
entirely blameless, as being the legislation of God:
for which cause it is, as Hecateus of Abdera says,
that the poets and historians make no mention of it,
nor of those men who lead their lives according to
it,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c007'><sup>[98]</sup></a> since it is a holy law, and ought not to be published
by profane mouths.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If then it please thee, O King, thou mayst
write to the high priest of the Jews, to send six of
the elders out of every tribe, and those such as are
most skilful of the laws, that by their means we may
learn the clear and agreeing sense of those books,
and may obtain an accurate <a id='interpretation' name='interpretation' />interpretation of their
contents, and so may have such a collection of these
as may be suitable to thy desire.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When this epistle was sent to the King, he commanded
that an epistle should be drawn up for
Eleazar, the Jewish high priest, concerning these
matters; and that they should inform him of the
release of the Jews that had been in slavery among
them. He also sent fifty talents of gold, for the
making of large basins, and vials, and cups, and an
immense quantity of precious stones. He also gave
order to those who had the custody of the chests that
contained those stones, to give the artificers leave to
choose out what sorts of them they pleased. He
withal appointed that a hundred talents in money
should be sent to the temple for sacrifices, and for
other uses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now I will give a description of these vessels, and
the manner of their construction, but not till after I
have set down a copy of the epistle which was written
to Eleazar the high priest, who had obtained that
dignity on the occasion following:—</p>

<p class='c006'>When Onias the high priest was dead, his son
Simon became his successor. He was called Simon
the Just, because of both his piety towards God, and
his kind disposition to those of his own nation. When
he was dead, and had left a young son, who was
called Onias, Simon’s brother Eleazar, of whom we
are speaking, took the high priesthood; and he it
was to whom Ptolemy wrote, and that in the manner
following:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“King Ptolemy to Eleazar the high priest, sendeth
greeting. There are many Jews who now dwell in
my kingdom, whom the Persians, when they were
in power, carried captives. These were honoured by
my father; some of whom he placed in the army,
and gave them greater pay than ordinary; to others
of them, when they came with him into Egypt, he
committed his garrisons, and the guarding of them,
that they might be a terror to the Egyptians; and
when I had taken the government, I treated all men
with humanity, and especially those that are thy
fellow-citizens, of whom I have set free above a hundred
thousand that were slaves, and paid the price of
their redemption to their masters out of my own
revenues; and those that are of a fit age, I have admitted
into the number of my soldiers; and for such
as are capable of being faithful to me, and proper for
my court, I have put them in such a post, as thinking
this (kindness done to them) to be a very great and
acceptable gift, which I devote to God for His providence
over me; and as I am desirous <a id='do' name='do' />to do what
will be grateful to these, and to all the other Jews in
the habitable earth, I have determined to procure an
interpretation of your law, and to have it translated
out of Hebrew into Greek, and to be deposited in my
library.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c007'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“Thou wilt therefore do well to choose out and
send to me men of a good character, who are now
elders in age, and six in number out of every tribe.
These, by their age, must be skilful in the laws, and
of abilities to make an accurate interpretation of
them; and when this shall be finished, I shall think
that I have done a work glorious to myself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I have sent to thee Andreas, the captain of
my guard, and Aristeus, men whom I have in very
great esteem; by whom I have sent those first-fruits
which I have dedicated to the temple, and to the
sacrifices, and to other uses, to the value of a hundred
talents; and if thou wilt send to us, to let us know
what thou wouldst have further, thou wilt do a thing
acceptable to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When this epistle of the King was brought to
Eleazar, he wrote an answer to it with all the respect
possible:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eleazar the high priest to King Ptolemy, sendeth
greeting. If thou and thy queen Arsinoe, and thy
children, be well, we are entirely satisfied. When
we received thy epistle, we greatly rejoiced at thy
intentions; and when the multitude were gathered
together, we read it to them, and thereby made them
sensible of the piety thou hast towards God. We
also showed them the twenty vials of gold, and thirty
of silver, and the five large basins, and the table for
the shew-bread; as also the hundred talents for the
sacrifices, and for the making what shall be needful
at the temple: which things Andreas and Aristeus,
those most honoured friends of thine, have brought
us; and truly they are persons of an excellent
character, and of great learning, and worthy of thy
virtue.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Know then that we will gratify thee in what is
for thy advantage, though we do what we used not
to do before; for we ought to make a return for the
numerous acts of kindness which thou hast done to
our countrymen. We immediately, therefore, offered
sacrifices for thee and thy sister, with thy children
and friends; and the multitude made prayers, that
thy affairs may be to thy mind; and that thy kingdom
may be preserved in peace, and that the translation
of our law may come to the conclusion thou
desirest, and be for thy advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have also chosen six elders out of every tribe,
whom we have sent, and the law with them. It will
be thy part, out of thy piety and justice, to send
back the law when it hath been translated; and to
return those to us that bring it in safety. Farewell!”</p>

<p class='c006'>This was the reply which the high priest made;
but it does not seem to me to be necessary to set down
the names of the seventy elders who were sent by
Eleazar, and carried the law, which yet were subjoined
at the end of the Epistle.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, I thought it not improper to give an
account of those very valuable and artificially contrived
vessels which the King sent to God, that all
may see how great a regard the King had for God,
for the King allowed a vast deal of expenses for
these vessels, and came often to the workmen, and
viewed their work, and suffered nothing of carelessness
or negligence to be any damage to their operations;
and I will relate how rich they were as well
as I am able, although, perhaps, the nature of this
history may not require such a description; but I
imagine I shall thereby recommend the elegant taste
and magnanimity of this King to those that read this
history.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, first, I will describe what belongs to the
table. It was, indeed, in the King’s mind to make
this table vastly large in its dimensions; but then he
gave orders that they should learn what was the
magnitude of the table which was already at Jerusalem,
and how large it was, and whether there were a
possibility of making one larger than it; and when
he was informed how large that was which was
already there, and that nothing hindered but a larger
might be made, he said that he was willing to have
one made that should be five times as large as the
present table; but his fear was, that it might be then
useless in their sacred ministrations by its too great
largeness; for he desired that the gifts he presented
them should not only be there for show, but should
be useful also in their sacred ministrations.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to which reasoning, that the former
table was made of so moderate a size for use, and
not for want of gold, he resolved that he would not
exceed the former table in largeness, but would make
it exceed it in the variety and elegancy of its materials;
and as he was sagacious in observing the nature
of all things, and in having a just notion of what
was new and surprising, and where there were no
sculptures, he would invent such as were proper by
his own skill, and would show them to the workmen,
he commanded that such sculptures should now be
made; and that those which were delineated should
<a id='be' name='be' />be most accurately formed, by a constant regard to
their delineation.</p>

<p class='c006'>When therefore the workmen had undertaken to
make the table, they framed it in length two cubits,
in breadth one cubit, and in height one cubit and a
half; and the entire structure of the work was of
gold. They withal made a crown of a hand-breadth
round it, with wave-work wreathed about it, and with
an engraving which imitated a cord, and was admirably
turned on its three parts; for as they were of a
triangular figure, every angle had the same disposition
of its sculptures, that when you turned them
about, the very same form of them was turned about
without any variation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that part of the crown-work that was enclosed
under the table had its sculptures very beautiful; but
that part which went round on the outside was more
elaborately adorned with most beautiful ornaments,
because it was exposed to sight, and to the view of
the spectators; for which reason it was that both
those sides which were extant above the rest were
acute, and none of the angles, which we before told
you were three, appeared less than another when the
table was turned about.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now into the cord-work thus turned were precious
stones inserted, in rows parallel one to the other, enclosed
in golden buttons, which had ouches in them;
but the parts which were on the side of the crown,
and were exposed to the sight, were adorned with a
row of oval figures obliquely placed, of the most excellent
sort of precious stones, which imitated rods
laid close, and encompassed the table round about;
but under these oval figures thus engraven, the
workmen had put a crown all round it, where the
nature of all sorts of fruit was represented, insomuch
that the bunches of grapes hung up; and when they
had made the stones to represent all the kinds of fruit
before mentioned, and that each in its proper colour,
they made them fast with gold round the whole
table.</p>

<p class='c006'>The like disposition of the oval figures, and of the
engraved rods, was framed under the crown, that the
table might on each side show the same appearance
of variety and elegancy of its ornaments, so that
neither the position of the wave-work nor of the
crown might be different, although the table were
turned on the other side, but that the prospect of the
same artificial contrivances might be extended as far
as the feet; for there was made a plate of gold four
fingers broad, through the entire breadth of the
table, into which they inserted the feet, and then
fastened them to the table by buttons and button-holes,
at the place where the crown was situate, that
so on what side soever of the table one should stand,
it might exhibit the very same view of the exquisite
workmanship, and of the vast expenses bestowed
upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But upon the table itself they engraved a meander,
inserting into it very valuable stones in the middle
like stars, of various colours; the carbuncle and the
emerald, each of which sent out agreeable rays of
light to the spectators; with such stones of other
sorts also as were most curious and best esteemed,
as being most precious in their kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hard by this meander a texture of network ran
round it, the middle of which appeared like a rhombus,
into which were inserted rock-crystal and amber,
which, by the great resemblance of the appearance
they made, gave wonderful delight to those that saw
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chapiters of the feet imitated the first budding
of lilies, while their leaves were bent and laid under
the table, but so that the chives were seen standing
upright within them. Their bases were made of a
carbuncle; and the place at the bottom, which rested
on that carbuncle, was one palm deep, and eight
fingers in breadth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now they had engraven upon it, with a very fine
tool, and with a great deal of pains, a branch of ivy,
and tendrils of the vine, sending forth clusters of
grapes, that you would guess they were nowise different
from real tendrils; for they were so very thin,
and so very far extended at their extremities, that
they were moved with the wind, and made one
believe that they were the product of nature, and not
the representation of art.</p>

<p class='c006'>They also made the entire workmanship of the
table appear to be three-fold, while the joints of the
several parts were so united together as to be invisible,
and the places where they joined could not be
distinguished. Now the thickness of the table was
not less than half a cubit.</p>

<p class='c006'>So that this gift by the King’s great generosity, by
the great value of the materials, and the variety of
its exquisite structure, and the artificer’s skill in
imitating nature with graving tools, was at length
brought to perfection, while the King was very desirous,
that though in largeness it were not to be
different from that which was already dedicated to
God, yet that in exquisite workmanship, and the
novelty of the contrivances, and in the splendour of
its construction, it should far exceed it, and be more
illustrious than that was.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now of the cisterns of gold there were two, whose
sculpture was of scale-work, from its basis to its
belt-like circle, with various sorts of stones enchased
in the spiral circles. Next to which there was upon
it a meander of a cubit in height: it was composed
of stones of all sorts of colours; and next to this
was the rod-work engraven; and next to that was a
rhombus in a texture of net-work, drawn out to the
brim of the basin, while small shields, made of stones,
beautiful in their kind, and of four fingers’ depth,
filled up the middle parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>About the top of the basin were wreathed the
leaves of lilies, and of the convolvulus, and the
tendrils of vines in a circular manner; and this was
the construction of the two cisterns of gold, each
containing two firkins;—but those which were of
silver were much more bright and splendid than
looking-glasses; and you might in them see images
that fell upon them more plainly than in the
other.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King also ordered thirty vials; those of which
the parts that were of gold, and filled up with
precious stones, were shadowed over with the leaves
of ivy and vines, artificially engraven; and these
were the vessels that were, after an extraordinary
manner, brought to this perfection, partly by the
skill of the workmen, who were admirable in such
fine work, but much more by the diligence and
generosity of the King, who not only supplied the
artificers abundantly, and with great generosity, with
what they wanted, but he forbade public audiences
for the time, and came and stood by the workmen,
and saw the whole operation; and this was the cause
why the workmen were so accurate in their performance,
because they had regard to the King, and
to his great concern about the vessels, and so the
more indefatigably kept close to the work.</p>

<p class='c006'>And these were what gifts were sent by Ptolemy
to Jerusalem, and dedicated to God there. But when
Eleazar the high priest had devoted them to God,
and had paid due respect to those that brought them,
and had given them presents to be carried to the
King, he dismissed them.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when they were come to Alexandria, and
Ptolemy heard that they were come, and that the
seventy elders were come also, he presently sent for
Andreas and Aristeus, his ambassadors, who came to
him, and delivered him the epistle which they brought
him from the high priest, and made answer to all the
questions he put to them by word of mouth. He
then made haste to meet the elders that came from
Jerusalem for the interpretation of the laws; and he
gave command, that everybody who came on other
occasions should be sent away, which was a thing
surprising, and what he did not use to do; for those
that were drawn thither upon such occasions used to
come to him on the fifth day, but ambassadors at the
month’s end.</p>

<p class='c006'>But when he had sent those away, he waited for
these that were sent by Eleazar; but as the old men
came in with the presents, which the high priest had
given them to bring to the King, and with the
membranes, upon which they had their laws written
in golden letters, he put questions to them concerning
those books; and when they had taken off the covers
wherein they were wrapt up, they showed him the
membranes.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the King stood admiring the thinness of those
membranes, and the exactness of the junctures, which
could not be perceived (so exactly were they connected
one with another); and this he did for a
considerable time. He then said that he returned
them thanks for coming to him, and still greater
thanks to him that sent them; and, above all, to
that God whose laws they appeared to be.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then did the elders, and those that were present
with them, cry out with one voice, and wished all
happiness to the King. Upon which he fell into
tears by the violence of the pleasure he had, it being
natural to men to afford the same indications in great
joy that they do under sorrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when he had bidden them deliver the books
to those that were appointed to receive them, he
saluted the men, and said that it was but just to
discourse, in the first place, of the errand they were
sent about, and then to address himself to themselves.
He promised, however, that he would make this day
on which they came to him remarkable and eminent
every year through the whole course of his life; for
their coming to him, and the victory which he gained
over Antigonus by sea, proved to be on the very same
day. He also gave orders that they should sup with
him; and gave it in charge that they should have
excellent lodgings provided for them in the upper
part of the city.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now he that was appointed to take care of the
reception of strangers, Nicanor by name, called for
Dorotheus, whose duty it was to make provision for
them, and bade him prepare for every one of them
what should be requisite for their diet and way of
living; which thing was ordered by the King after
this manner: he took care that those that belonged
to every city, which did not use the same way of
living, that all things should be prepared for them
according to the custom of those that came to him,
that being feasted according to the usual method of
their own way of living, they might be the better
pleased, and might not be uneasy at anything done
to them from which they were naturally averse.</p>

<p class='c006'>And this was now done in the case of these men
by Dorotheus, who was put into this office because
of his great skill in such matters belonging to common
life: for he took care of all such matters as concerned
the reception of strangers, and appointed them double
seats for them to sit on, according as the King had
commanded him to do; for he had commanded that
half of their seats should be set at his right hand,
and the other half behind his table, and took care
that no respect should be omitted that could be shown
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when they were thus set down, he bid
Dorotheus to minister to all those that were come to
him from Judea, after the manner they used to be
ministered to; for which cause he sent away their
sacred heralds, and those that slew the sacrifices, and
the rest that used to say grace: but called to one
of those that were come to him, whose name was
Eleazar, who was a priest, and desired him to say
grace: who then stood in the midst of them, and
prayed that all prosperity might attend the King
and those that were his subjects. Upon which an
acclamation was made by the whole company, with
joy and a great noise; and when that was over, they
fell to eating their supper, and to the enjoyment of
what was set before them.</p>

<p class='c006'>And at a little interval afterward, when the King
thought a sufficient time had been interposed, he
began to talk philosophically to them, and he asked
every one of them a philosophical question, and such
a one as might give light in those inquiries; and
when they had explained all the problems that had
been proposed by the King about every point, he was
well pleased with their answers. This took up the
twelve days in which they were treated; and he
that pleases may learn the particular questions in
that book of Aristeus, which he wrote on this very
occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>And while not the King only, but the philosopher
Menedus also, admired them, and said, that all things
were governed by Providence, and that it was probable
that thence it was that such force or beauty
was discovered in these men’s words,—they then left
off asking any more questions. But the King said
that he had gained very great advantages by their
coming, for that he had received this profit from
them, that he had learned how he ought to rule his
subjects. And he gave order that they should have
every one three talents given them; and that those
that were to conduct them to their lodgings should
do it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Accordingly, when three days were over, Demetrius
took them, and went over the causeway seven
furlongs long: it was a bank in the sea to an island.
And when they had gone over the bridge, he proceeded
to the northern parts, and showed them
where they should meet, which was in a house which
was built near the shore, and was a quiet place,
and fit for their discoursing together about their
work.</p>

<p class='c006'>When he had brought them thither, he entreated
them (now they had all things about them which
they wanted for the interpretation of their law), that
they would suffer nothing to interrupt them in their
work. Accordingly, they made an accurate interpretation,
with great zeal and great pains; and this
they continued to do till the ninth hour of the day;
after which time they relaxed and took care of their
body, while their food was provided for them in great
plenty: besides, Dorotheus, at the King’s command,
brought them a great deal of what was provided for
the King himself. But in the morning they came to
the court, and saluted Ptolemy, and then went away
to their former place, where, when they had washed
their hands and purified themselves, they betook
themselves to the interpretation of the laws.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now when the law was transcribed, and the labour
of interpretation was over, which came to its conclusion
in seventy-two days, Demetrius gathered all
the Jews together to the place where the laws were
translated, and where the interpreters were, and read
them over. The multitude did also approve of those
elders that were the interpreters of the law. They
withal commended Demetrius for his proposal, as the
inventor of what was greatly for their happiness; and
they desired that he would give leave to their rulers
also to read the law.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover they all, both the priests and the
ancientest of the elders, and the principal men of
their commonwealth, made it their request, that
since the interpretation was happily finished, it might
continue in the state it now was, and might not be
altered. And when they all commended that determination
of theirs, they enjoined, that if any one
observed either anything superfluous, or anything
omitted, that he would take a view of it again, and
have it laid before them, and corrected; which was
a wise action of theirs, that when the thing was
judged to have been well done, it might continue
for ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the King rejoiced when he saw that his design
of this nature was brought to perfection, to so great
advantage: and he was chiefly delighted with hearing
the laws read to him; and was astonished at the deep
meaning and wisdom of the legislator. And he began
to discourse with Demetrius, “How it came to pass
that, when this legislation was so wonderful, no one,
either of the poets or of the historians, had made
mention of it.” Demetrius made answer, “that no
one durst be so bold as to touch upon the description
of these laws, because they were Divine and venerable,
and because some that had attempted it were afflicted
by God.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He also told him that “Theopompus was desirous
of writing somewhat about them, but was thereupon
disturbed in his mind for above thirty days’ time;
and upon some intermission of his distemper he
appeased God (by prayer), as suspecting that his
madness proceeded from that cause.” Nay, indeed,
he further saw in a dream that his distemper befell
him while he indulged too great a curiosity about
Divine matters, and was desirous of publishing them
among common men; but when he left off that
attempt, he recovered his understanding again.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover he informed him of Theodectes, the
tragic poet, concerning whom it was reported that,
when in a certain dramatic representation, he was
desirous to make mention of things that were contained
in the sacred books, he was afflicted with a
darkness in his eyes; and that upon his being conscious
of the occasion of his distemper, and appeasing
God (by prayer), he was freed from that affliction.</p>

<p class='c006'>And when the King had received these books from
Demetrius, as we have said already, he adored them;
and gave order, that great care should be taken of
them, that they might remain uncorrupted. He also
desired that the interpreters would come often to
him out of Judea, and that both on account of the
respect which he would pay them, and on account of
the presents he would make them; for he said, it
was now but just to send them away, although if, of
their own accord, they would come to him hereafter,
they should obtain all that their own wisdom might
justly require, and what his generosity was able to
give them.</p>

<p class='c006'>So he sent them away, and gave to every one of
them three garments of the best sort, and two talents
of gold, and a cup of the value of one talent,
and the furniture of the room wherein they were
feasted. And these were the things he presented to
them. But by them he sent to Eleazar the high
priest ten beds, with feet of silver, and the furniture
to them belonging, and a cup of the value of thirty
talents, and besides these, ten garments, and purple,
and a very beautiful crown, and a hundred pieces
of the finest woven linen; as also vials and dishes,
and vessels for pouring, and two golden cisterns, to
be dedicated to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>He also desired him, by an epistle, that he would
give these interpreters leave, if any of them were
desirous of coming to him; because he highly valued
a conversation with men of such learning, and should
be very willing to lay out his wealth upon such men.
And this was what came to the Jews, and was much
to their glory and honour, from Ptolemy Philadelphus.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c007'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Egyptians say that this Cheops<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c007'><sup>[102]</sup></a> reigned fifty
years; and when he died, his brother Chephren succeeded
to the kingdom; and he followed the same
practices as the other, both in other respects, and in
building a pyramid; which does not come up to the
dimensions of his brother’s, for I myself measured
them; nor has it subterraneous chambers; nor does a
channel from the Nile flow to it, as to the other; but
this flows through an artificial aqueduct round an
island within, in which they say the body of Cheops
is laid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having laid the first course of variegated Ethiopian
stones, less in height than the other by forty
feet, he built it near the large Pyramid. They both
stand on the same hill,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c007'><sup>[103]</sup></a> which is about a hundred
feet high. Chephren, they said, reigned fifty-six
years.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus one hundred and six years are reckoned,
during which the Egyptians suffered all kinds of
calamities,<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c007'><sup>[104]</sup></a> and for this length of time the temples
were closed and never opened. From the hatred
they bear them, the Egyptians are not very willing to
mention their names; but call the Pyramids after
Philition,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c007'><sup>[105]</sup></a> a shepherd, who at that time kept his

<p class='c012'>These extracts are given as showing the real

their mysterious intercourse with the Hyperboreans,
who were the followers of Moses in the Far East;
their observance of the law given by Moses to the
Hebrews, and commemorative representation of the
marvellous escape from Egypt into Arabia; and
include a description of the Islands of Delos and
Rhenea.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c006'>“Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this
song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing
unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously:
the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his
name. Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast
into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned
in the Red Sea. The depths have covered them:
they sank into the bottom as a stone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake,
I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied
upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall
destroy them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered
them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.”<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c007'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread:
(thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I
commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month
Abib; for in it thou camest out of Egypt: and none
shall appear before me empty:)</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy
labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the
feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year,
when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the
field.”<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c007'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>The following narrative describes the manner in
which the Greeks practised the above law, and
represented the crossing of the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c007'><sup>[108]</sup></a> charming season (spring) brought with it
festivals still more charming: I mean those which
are celebrated every four years in Delos, in honour
of Diana and Apollo. The worship of these two
divinities has subsisted in that island for a long succession
of ages. But as it latterly began to decline,
the Athenians instituted, during the Peloponnesian
war, games which drew thither a great concourse of
people from various nations.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The youth of Athens were eager to distinguish
themselves in these, and the whole city was in
motion. Preparations were likewise made for the
solemn deputation which is annually sent to the
temple of Delos, to present a tribute of gratitude for
the victory which Theseus gained over the Minotaur.
The voyage is made in the same ship which carried
that hero to Crete; and already the priest of Apollo
had crowned its stern with his sacred hands. The
sea was covered with small vessels which were getting
under sail for Delos.</p>

<p class='c006'>“On the next day we coasted Scyros, and, leaving
Tenos on the left, entered into the channel which
separates Delos from the island of Rhenea. We
immediately came in sight of the temple of Apollo,
which we saluted with new transports of joy; and
the city of Delos was almost entirely displayed to
our view.</p>

<p class='c006'>“With an eager eye we ran over the superb
edifices, elegant porticoes, and forests of columns by
which it is embellished; and this prospect, momentarily
varying, suspended in us the desire to arrive
at the land.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When we had reached the shore, we ran to the
temple, which is distant from it only about a hundred
paces. It is more than a thousand years since
Erisichthon, son of Cecrops,<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c007'><sup>[109]</sup></a> laid the first foundation
of this edifice, to which the different states of Greece
continually add new embellishments. It was covered
with festoons and garlands, which, by the contrast of
their colours, gave a new lustre to the Parian marble
of which it is built.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Within we saw the statue of Apollo, less celebrated
for the delicacy of the workmanship than its
antiquity. The god is represented holding his bow
in one hand; and to signify that music owes to him
its origin and charms, with his left he supports the
three Graces, who are represented, the first with a
lyre, the second with flutes, and the third with a
pipe.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Near the statue is that altar which is esteemed
one of the wonders of the world. It is not gold or
marble which is admired in it; horns of animals,
forcibly bent, and artfully interwoven, form a whole
equally solid and regular. Some priests, whose
employment it is to adorn it with flowers and
boughs, made us observe the ingenious contexture
of its parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘It was the god himself,’ exclaimed a young
priest, ‘who in his childhood interwove them as you
see. Those menacing horns, which you behold suspended
on the wall, and those of which the altar is
composed, are the spoils of the wild goats which fed
on Mount Cynthus, and which fell beneath the shafts
of Diana. Here the eye meets nothing but prodigies.
This palm tree, which displays its branches over our
heads, is the sacred tree that supported Latona when
she brought forth the divinities we adore.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘The form of this altar has become celebrated
by a problem in geometry, of which an exact solution
will perhaps never be given. The plague laid waste
our island, and Greece was ravaged by war. The
oracle, being consulted by our ancestors, declared
that these calamities would cease if they could make
this altar double the size it is of at present. They
imagined it would be sufficient to make it twice as
large every way; but they found, with surprise,
that they were constructing an enormous mass that
would contain the altar in question eight times.
After other attempts, equally fruitless, they sent to
consult Plato, then just returned from Egypt; who
told their messengers, that the god, by this oracle,
sported with the ignorance of the Greeks, and
exhorted them to cultivate the accurate sciences,
rather than to be continually occupied in dissensions
and wars. At the same time he proposed a simple
and mechanical method of resolving the problem;
but the plague had ceased when his answer arrived.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“These words, though <a id='pronounced' name='pronounced' />pronounced in a low voice,
engaged the attention of a citizen of Delos, who
approached us, and showing us an altar less embellished
than the former: ‘This,’ said he, ‘is never
drenched with the blood of victims; on this the
devouring flame is never kindled. Hither Pythagoras
came, to offer, after the example of the people,
cakes, barley, and wheat; and beyond all doubt the
god was better pleased with the enlightened worship
of that great man than with all those streams of
blood with which our altars are perpetually inundated.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Island of Delos is only seven or eight miles
in circuit, and its breadth is but about one third of
its length. Mount Cynthus, which extends from
north to south, terminates in a plain that on the west
side reaches to the sea. The city stands in this plain.
The rest of the island presents only an uneven and
sterile soil, if we except some pleasant valleys, which
are formed by several hills, on the south side. The
source of the Inopus is the only spring with which it
is favoured by nature; but we find, in different
places, cisterns and lakes, which preserve the rain-water
during several months.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Delos was originally governed by kings, who
united the priesthood to the regal authority. It
afterwards fell under the power of the Athenians,
who purified it, during the Peloponnesian war. The
tombs of its ancient inhabitants were removed to the
Isle of Rhenea; and there their successors have seen
for the first time the light of day, and there are they
to behold it for the last. But if they are deprived
of the advantage of being born and dying in their
own country, they enjoy there a profound tranquillity
during their lives.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The fury of barbarians, the enmity of nations,
and the animosities of individuals, all subside at the
view of this sacred land; nor ever have the coursers
of Mars trodden it with their ensanguined feet.
Everything that can present the image of war is
rigorously banished; and even the animal most
faithful to man is not suffered to remain in it,
because he would destroy the weaker and more
timid creatures.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At length the day arrived which had been expected
with so much impatience. The morning
faintly indicated in the horizon the course of the sun,
when we arrived at the foot of Cynthus.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This mountain is but of a moderate height. It
is a block of granite, of different colours, and containing
pieces of a blackish and shining talc. From
its top a surprising number of islands of various
sizes are discoverable. They are dispersed in the
midst of the ocean, in the same beautiful disorder as
the stars are scattered in the heavens. Here the
bosom of the waves is become the habitation of mortals.
We behold a city scattered over the surface of
the sea; and view the picture of Egypt when the
Nile has inundated the plains, and appears to bear
on its waters the hills which afford a retreat to the
inhabitants. The greater part of these islands are
named Cyclades, because they form a kind of circle
round Delos. Sesostris, King of Egypt, subjected a
part of them by his arms; and Minos, King of Crete,
governed some of them by his laws. The Phœnicians,
the Carians, the Persians, the Greeks, and all
the nations which have possessed the empire of the
sea, have successively conquered or colonized them:
but the colonies of the latter have effaced all traces
of those of other nations; and powerful interests
have for ever attached the destiny of the Cyclades to
that of Greece.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Their inhabitants are separated by the sea, but
united by pleasure. They have festivals which are
common to them, and which assemble them together
sometimes in one place and sometimes in another;
but these cease the moment our solemnities commence.
Thus, according to Homer, the gods suspend
their profound deliberations, and arise from their
thrones, when Apollo appears in the midst of them.
The neighbouring temples are about to be deserted;
the divinities there adored permit the incense destined
to them to be conveyed to Delos. Solemn deputations,
known by the name of Theoriæ, are charged
with this illustrious commission. They bring with
them choruses of boys and maidens, who are the
triumph of beauty, and the principal ornament of our
festivals. They repair hither from the coasts of Asia,
the islands of the Ægean sea, the continent of
Greece, and the most distant countries. They arrive
to the sound of musical instruments, to the voice of
pleasure, and with all the pomp that taste and magnificence
can furnish. The vessels which bring them are
covered with flowers; chaplets of flowers are worn by
the mariners and pilots; and their joy is the more
expressive as they consider it as a religious duty to
forget every care by which it may be destroyed or
abated. The small fleets which bring the offerings
to Delos had already left the ports of Mycone and
Rhenea, and other fleets appeared at a distance. An
infinite number of vessels of every kind flew over
the surface of the sea, resplendent with a thousand
different colours. They were seen to issue from the
channels which separate the islands, cross, pursue,
and join each other. A fresh gale played in their
purple sails; and the waves beneath their oars were
covered with a foam, which reflected the rays of the
rising sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At the foot of the mountain an immense multitude
overspread the plain. The crowds of people
advanced, and fell back, with a motion resembling
that of a field of corn when agitated by the wind;
and the transports of joy by which they were animated
produced a vague and confused sound that
seemed to float over that vast body.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the meantime, the Theoria of the Athenians
was perceived at a distance. A number of light
vessels seemed to sport round the sacred galley. At
sight of them, some old men, who had with difficulty
come down to the beach, regretted their youthful
days, when Nicias, the general of the Athenians, was
appointed to conduct the Theoria. He did not proceed
with it, said they to us, immediately to Delos;
but brought it secretly to the Isle of Rhenea, which
you see before you. <em>The whole night was employed in
erecting over the channel between the two islands a
bridge, the materials of which, prepared long before,
and richly gilt and painted, only required to be joined
together.</em> It was nearly four <i>stadia</i> (about 3 furlongs
and 145 yards) in length, covered with superb
carpets, and ornamented with garlands; <em>and on the
day following</em>, at early dawn, the Theoria crossed the
sea, not, like the army of Xerxes, to ravage and lay
waste nations, but bringing to them pleasures in its
train; and, that they might taste the first-fruits of
these, it remained long suspended over the waves,
chanting sacred songs, and delighting all eyes with a
glorious spectacle which the sun will never again
behold.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The number of those foreign merchants whom
the situation of the island, the privileges it enjoys, the
vigilant attention of the Athenians, and the celebrity
of the festivals, bring in crowds to Delos; whither
they come to exchange their respective riches for the
corn, wine, and commodities of the neighbouring
islands; for the scarlet linen tunics, which are made
in the isle of Amorgos, the rich purple stuffs of <i>Cos</i>,
the highly-esteemed alum of Melos, and the valuable
copper that from time immemorial has been extracted
from the mines of Delos, and of which are made
elegant vases. The island was become as it were the
storehouse of the treasures of nations; and near the
place where they were collected, the inhabitants of
Delos, obliged by an express law to furnish water to
the whole multitude of strangers, set out, on long
tables, cakes, and eatables prepared in haste.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c007'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>“A sudden shout announced the arrival of the
Theoria of the Tenians, who, besides their own
offerings, brought also those of the Hyperboreans.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The latter people dwell towards the north of
Greece: they especially pay adoration to Apollo; and
there is still to be seen at Delos the tomb of two of
his priestesses, who came thither to add new rites to
the worship of that god. They also preserve there,
in an edifice dedicated to Diana, the ashes of the last
Theori, whom the Hyperboreans sent to their island.
They unfortunately perished; and, since that event,
that nation has sent the first-fruits of their harvests
through a foreign channel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A neighbouring tribe of the Scythians receive
them from their hands, and transmit them to other
nations, who convey them to the shores of the
Adriatic sea, from whence they are carried to Epirus,
cross Greece, arrive at Eubœa, and are brought to
Tenos.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The fleets of the Theoriæ presented their prows
to the shore, and these prows art had decorated with
the symbols peculiar to each nation. Those of the
Phthiotes were distinguished by the figures of
Nereides. On the Athenian galley, Pallas was represented
guiding a resplendent car; and the ships of
the Bœotians were ornamented with an image of
Cadmus holding a serpent.”</p>

land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord
because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a
saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.
And the Lord shall be known to Egypt, and the
Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall
do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow
unto the Lord, and perform it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the Lord shall smite Egypt: he shall smite
and heal it: and they shall return even to the Lord,
and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In that day shall there be a highway out of
Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into
Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the
Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt
and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the
land: whom the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying,
Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work
of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.”—Isa. xix.

year after the children of Israel went down into Egypt, the
Pharaoh the friend of Joseph died. Joseph was then seventy-one
years of age. Before his death, Pharaoh commanded his
son who succeeded him to obey Joseph in all things, and the
same instructions he left in writing. Thus, while this Pharaoh
reigned over Egypt the country was governed by Joseph’s
advice and counsel. Joseph lived in Egypt ninety-three years,
as a prince of the country eighty years of that time. Chephren
the brother was no other than Benjamin, who was Joseph’s
brother. Joseph’s age when he died was one hundred and ten
years; and his body was embalmed and afterwards laid in the
ground near the banks of the river Nile, in the subterranean
island near the Great Pyramid. During Joseph’s lifetime the
temples were closed, and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
was worshipped.</p>
